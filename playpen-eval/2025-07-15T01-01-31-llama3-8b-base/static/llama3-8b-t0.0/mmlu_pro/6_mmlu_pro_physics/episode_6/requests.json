Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nOptions:\nA. 1000 times more\nB. 50 times more\nC. 5000 times more\nD. 500 times more\nE. 10000 times more\nF. 20000 times more\nG. 2000 times more\nH. 100 times more\nI. 10 times more\nJ. N/A\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nOptions:\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nE. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.\nF. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nG.

N/A\nThe answer is (A)\n\nQuestion:\nA refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\nOptions:\nA. 10\nB. 40\nC. 6\nD. 25\nE. 15\nF. 50\nG. 30\nH. 4\nI. 5\nJ. 20\nThe answer is (H)\n\nQuestion:\nColors in a soap bubble result from light\nOptions:\nA. dispersion\nB. deflection\nC. refraction\nD. reflection\nE. interference\nF. converted to a different frequency\nG. polarization\nH. absorption\nI. diffraction\nJ. transmission\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nA microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nOptions:\nA. 240 W\nB. 120 W\nC. 10 W\nD. 480 W\nE. 360 W\nF. 200 W\nG. 30 W\nH. 150 W\nI. 60 W\nJ. 300 W\nThe answer is (A)\n\nQuestion:\nA house near a lake is kept warm by a heat engine. In winter, water from beneath the ice covering the lake is pumped through the heat engine. Heat is extracted until the water is on the point of freezing when it is ejected. The outside air is used as a sink. Assume that the air temperature is -15 째C and the temperature of the water from the lake is 2째C. Calculate the rate at which water must be pumped to the engine. The efficiency of the engine is one-fifth that of a Carnot engine and the house requires 10 kW.\nOptions:\nA. 125 liters/s\nB. 150 liters/s\nC. 90 liters/s\nD. 75 liters/s\nE. 102.4 liters/s\nF. 60 liters/s\nG. 250 liters/s\nH. 50 liters/s\nI. 180 liters/s\nJ. 200 liters/s<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
