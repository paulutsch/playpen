Let's denote the variables as follows: \n\n- S: Smoking status (1 for smokers, 0 for nonsmokers)\n- E: Effort (1 for high effort, 0 for low effort)\n- A: College admission (1 for admitted, 0 for not admitted)\n\nGiven the conditions, we have the following causal relationships:\n\n1. S → E (Smoking affects effort)\n2. E → A (Effort affects college admission)\n\nWe are also given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(A = 1 | S = 0) = 0.67 (Probability of college admission for nonsmokers)\n- P(A = 1 | S = 1) = 0.55 (Probability of college admission for smokers)\n\nThe question asks whether it would be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker, given that they are a smoker. This is equivalent to asking whether the probability of college admission would decrease if the student's smoking status were to change from 1 to 0.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the potential outcomes and their probabilities. Let's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\n\n- A0: College admission if the student is a nonsmoker\n- A1: College admission if the student is a smoker\n\nWe are interested in the probability of A0 given that the student is a smoker,",
