The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

U → C (Unobserved confounders affects education level)\n2. U → S (Unobserved confounders affects salary)\n3. C → S (Education level affects salary)\n4. P → C (Proximity to a college affects education level)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(S|P=far) = 0.39\n- P(S|P=close) = 0.49\n- P(C|P=far) = 0.57\n- P(C|P=close) = 0.30\n\nTo determine whether a college degree or higher (C) increases the chance of a high salary (S), we need to compare the causal effect of C on S, while controlling for the confounding variable U.\n\nUsing the potential outcomes framework, we can define the causal effect of C on S as:\n\nP(S|C=1, U=u) - P(S|C=0, U=u)\n\nwhere C=1 represents having a college degree or higher, and",
