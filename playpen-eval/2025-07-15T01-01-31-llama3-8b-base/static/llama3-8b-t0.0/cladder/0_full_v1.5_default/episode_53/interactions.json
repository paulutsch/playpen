The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we need to consider the overall effect of S on L, not just the conditional probabilities.\n\nTo do this, we can use the backdoor criterion, which states that if we can block all backdoor paths from S to L, then S is a causal effect of L.\n\nIn this case, we have the following backdoor paths:\n- S -> F (direct effect)\n- F -> L (direct effect)\n- S -> D (no direct effect, but D has a direct effect on L)\n- D -> L (direct effect)\n\nHowever, we also have the following confounding variables:\n- F and S are correlated (CEOs who fire employees are more likely to have managers who sign termination letters)\n- F and L are correlated (CEOs who fire employees are more likely to have employees with large feet)\n\nTo block these backdoor paths, we need to condition on the common cause of F and S, which is the CEO's",
