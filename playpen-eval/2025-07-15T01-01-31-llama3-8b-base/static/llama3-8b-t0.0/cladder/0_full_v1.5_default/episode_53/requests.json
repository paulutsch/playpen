The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, we need to consider the overall effect of S on L, not just the conditional probabilities.\n\nTo do this, we can use the backdoor criterion, which states that if we can block all backdoor paths from S to L, then S is a causal effect of L.\n\nIn this case, we have the following backdoor paths:\n- S -> F (direct effect)\n- F -> L (direct effect)\n- S -> D (no direct effect, but D has a direct effect on L)\n- D -> L (direct effect)\n\nHowever, we also have the following confounding variables:\n- F and S are correlated (CEOs who fire employees are more likely to have managers who sign termination letters)\n- F and L are correlated (CEOs who fire employees are more likely to have employees with large feet)\n\nTo block these backdoor paths, we need to condition on the common cause of F and S, which is the CEO's",
