	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%. For those who are yomx, would it be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the concept of counterfactuals and the potential outcome framework. We are interested in the probability of xevu given that the individual is yomx, but also given that the individual is not yomx. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote the probability of xevu given yomx as P(xevu|yomx) = 0.4, and the probability of xevu given not yomx as P(xevu|not yomx) = 0.68.\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to compare the probability of xevu if the individual was not yomx, but still had the potential to be yomx (i.e., the counterfactual probability). This is equivalent to asking: what is the probability of xevu if the individual was not yomx, but had the same potential outcome as yomx?\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the potential outcome framework, we can represent the probability of xevu given not yomx as a weighted average of the potential outcomes:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(xevu|not yomx) = P(xevu|yomx) * P(yomx|not yomx) + P(xevu|not yomx) * P(not yomx|not yomx)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(not yomx|not yomx) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(xevu|not y
