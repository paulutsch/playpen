Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can do this by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(A = 1) = P(A = 1 | M = 1) \\* P(M = 1) + P(A = 1 | M = 0) \\* P(M = 0)\n\nSubstituting the",
