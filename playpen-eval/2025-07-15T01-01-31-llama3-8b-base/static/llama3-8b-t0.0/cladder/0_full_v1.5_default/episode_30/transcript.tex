	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

Demand has a direct effect on supply and price.\\ \tt 2. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply.\\ \tt 3. Supply has a direct effect on price.\\ \tt 4. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%.\\ \tt 5. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%.\\ \tt 6. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to compare the probability of increased price (P+) and reduced price (P-). To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes of supply (S) and their corresponding probabilities.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's define the following potential outcomes:\\ \tt \\ \tt - S+: Increased supply\\ \tt - S-: Reduced supply\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(S+) = 78% (overall probability of increased supply)\\ \tt - P(P+|S-) = 44% (probability of increased price given reduced supply)\\ \tt - P(P+|S+) = 81% (probability of increased price given increased supply)\\ \tt \\ \tt To compare the probability of increased price (P+) and reduced price (P-), we need to consider the following:\\ \tt \\ \tt - If supply is increased (S+), the probability of
