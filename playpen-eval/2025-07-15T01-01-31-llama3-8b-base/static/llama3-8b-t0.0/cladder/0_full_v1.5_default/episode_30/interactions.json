The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
