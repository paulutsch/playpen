The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 1%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Zory → zuph\n2. Zory → glimx\n3. zuph → jyka\n4. jyka → glimx\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(zuph) = 8%\n- P(not zuph and glimx) = 58%\n- P(zuph and glimx) = 1%\n\nWe want to determine if P(glimx|zuph) < P(glimx). To do this, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(glimx) and P(glimx|zuph).\n\nP(glimx) = P(glimx|zuph) * P(zuph) + P(glimx|not zuph) * P(not zuph)\n\nWe know P(zuph) = 8% and P(not zuph and glimx) = 58%. Since P(not zuph and glimx) includes the cases where glimx is true and zuph is false, we can infer that P(glimx|not zuph) is greater than 0. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate P(glimx|zup",
