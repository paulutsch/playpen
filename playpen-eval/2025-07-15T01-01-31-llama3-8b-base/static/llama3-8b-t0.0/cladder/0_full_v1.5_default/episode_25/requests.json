Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 32%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship between gender and admission status may be due to the effect of residency status on both variables. For example, males may be more likely to be international students, who face more competitive admission processes, while females may be more likely to be domestic students, who face less competitive admission processes. \n\nIn this scenario, the observed difference in admission probabilities between males and non-males may be due to the effect of residency status rather than the effect of gender itself. Therefore, we cannot conclude that male gender increases the chance of admission acceptance without controlling for the effect of residency status.<|eot_id|>",
