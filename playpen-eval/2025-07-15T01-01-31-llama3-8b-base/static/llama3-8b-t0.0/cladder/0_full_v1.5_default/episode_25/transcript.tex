	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 32%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt Although the probability of admission acceptance is lower for males (32%) compared to non-males (40%), we cannot conclude that male gender increases the chance of admission acceptance. \\ \tt \\ \tt This is because the effect of gender on admission status is confounded by the unobserved variable, residency status. The relationship between gender and admission status may be due to the effect of residency status on both variables. For example, males may be more likely to be international students, who face more competitive admission processes, while females may be more likely to be domestic students, who face less competitive admission processes. \\ \tt \\ \tt In this scenario, the observed difference in admission probabilities between males and non-males may be due to the effect of residency status rather than the effect of gender itself. Therefore, we cannot conclude that male gender increases the chance of admission acceptance without controlling for the effect of residency status.
