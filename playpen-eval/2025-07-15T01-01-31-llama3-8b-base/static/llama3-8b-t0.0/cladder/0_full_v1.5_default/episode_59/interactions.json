The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To answer this, we need to compare the probability of low cholesterol among individuals with a sister (S=1) to the probability of low cholesterol among individuals without a sister (S=0).\n\nUsing the given probabilities:\n\n- P(S=1) = 0.2\n- P(S=0) = 0.8\n- P(C=low, S=1) = 0.14\n- P(C=low, S=0) = 0.65\n\nWe can calculate the probability of low cholesterol among individuals with a sister as follows:\n\nP(C=low | S=1) = P(C=low, S=1) / P(S=1) = 0.14 / 0.2 = 0.7\n\nWe can calculate the probability of low cholesterol among",
