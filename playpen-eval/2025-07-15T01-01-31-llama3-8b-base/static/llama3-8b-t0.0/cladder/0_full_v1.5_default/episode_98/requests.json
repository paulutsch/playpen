Wibl has a direct effect on uvzi. We know that zuph causes not wibl, and we know that wibl causes not uvzi.

This means that the causal graph is actually empty, as there are no direct causal relationships between the variables.\n\nIn this case, we cannot conclude that an individual is not uvzi if Zuph instead of not Zuph, because there is no causal relationship between Zuph and Uvzi. The absence of a causal link between Zuph and Uvzi means that the value of Zuph does not affect the value of Uvzi, regardless of whether Zuph is present or absent.<|eot_id|>",
