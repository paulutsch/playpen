The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. We know that zory causes zuph. zuph causes not jyka. zory or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is zory. Would an individual is not glimx if not zuph instead of zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This implies that Zuph is a mediator of the effect of Zory on Glimx, since Zory or Jyka causes Glimx.\n\nHowever, we are also given that Zuph causes not Jyka, which means that the effect of Zuph on Glimx is not direct, but rather through Jyka. This creates a situation where the effect of Zory on Glimx is mediated by both Zuph and Jyka.\n\nNow, let's consider the counterfactual scenario where Zuph is not present instead of being present. In this case, the effect of Zory on Glimx would be mediated only by Jyka, since Zuph is not present to mediate the effect.\n\nHowever, we are given that Zory or Jyka causes Glimx, which means that the effect of Zory on Glimx is not entirely dependent on Jyka. In other words, Zory has a direct effect on Glimx, which is not mediated by Jyka.\n\nTherefore, even if Zuph is not present, the effect of Zory on Glimx would still be present, since Zory has a direct effect on Glimx.
