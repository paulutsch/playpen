	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Cwoi has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. Cwoi is unobserved. For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%. For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%. For those who are not yomx, the probability of gwet is 64%. For those who are yomx, the probability of gwet is 8%. For those who are yomx, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of counterfactuals and potential outcomes. We are asked to compare the probability of xevu for an individual who is yomx with the probability of xevu for the same individual if they were not yomx.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote the potential outcome of xevu for an individual who is yomx as P(xevu|yomx) and the potential outcome of xevu for the same individual if they were not yomx as P(xevu|not yomx).\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given that for those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%, and for those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%. We can calculate the overall probability of xevu for individuals who are yomx as a weighted average of these two probabilities, using the probability of gwet given yomx as the weight:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(xevu|yomx) = P(gwet|yomx) * P(xevu|yomx, gwet) + P(not gwet|yomx) * P(xevu|yomx, not gwet)\\ \tt = 0.08 * 0.91 + 0.92 * 0.31\\ \tt = 0.0732 +
