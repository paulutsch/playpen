	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, the chance of wet ground is larger when observing rainy season.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of conditional probability and the potential outcome framework. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let's define the variables:\\ \tt \\ \tt - S: Season (rainy or dry)\\ \tt - W: Weather (rainy or dry)\\ \tt - G: Ground (wet or dry)\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the conditions, we have the following direct effects:\\ \tt \\ \tt - S → W (Season affects weather)\\ \tt - S → G (Season affects ground)\\ \tt - W → G (Weather affects ground)\\ \tt - S → G (Sprinkler affects ground)\\ \tt \\ \tt However, since the sprinkler's effect on ground is mentioned, but it's not directly related to the question, we can ignore it for now.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(S = Rainy) = 0.87\\ \tt - P(G = Wet | S = Dry) = 0.07\\ \tt - P(G = Wet | S = Rainy) = 0.5\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine if the chance of wet ground is larger when observing rainy season, we need to compare the conditional probabilities P(G = Wet | S = Rainy) and P(G = Wet | S = Dry).\\ \tt \\ \tt However, we are not directly given P(G = Wet | S = Dry). To find it, we can use the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G = Wet) = P(G = Wet | S = Rainy) * P(S
