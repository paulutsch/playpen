This suggests that the chance of brown eyes is not larger when observing encouragement.\n\nHowever, we can further investigate this by considering the causal relationships between the variables. The given conditions state that encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes, and studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. This suggests that the relationship between encouragement and brown eyes may be mediated by studying habit.\n\nTo determine whether the chance of brown eyes is larger when observing encouragement, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of studying habit.",
