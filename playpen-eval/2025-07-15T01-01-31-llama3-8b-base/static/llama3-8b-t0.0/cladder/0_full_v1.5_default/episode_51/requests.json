Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 88%. For people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. For people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 58%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 13%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 9%. For people who have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 64%.

The presence of a brother has a direct effect on the wife, and the wife has a direct effect on the alarm clock. \n\nWe can use the potential outcomes framework to analyze this situation. Let's define the presence of a brother as B, the wife setting the alarm as W, and the alarm ringing as A. We are interested in the effect of B on A through W.\n\nTo establish a negative effect, we would need to show that the presence of a brother decreases the probability of the alarm ringing when the wife sets the alarm. However, the given data does not support this claim.\n\nFor people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 13%. The presence of a brother actually decreases the probability of the alarm ringing when the wife sets the alarm, but this is not a negative effect; it's a decrease in the probability of the alarm ringing, which is not the same as a negative effect.\n\nA negative effect would imply that the presence of a brother decreases the probability of the alarm ringing when the wife sets the alarm, but in this case, the presence of a brother actually decreases the probability of the wife setting the alarm (from 9% to 64%",
