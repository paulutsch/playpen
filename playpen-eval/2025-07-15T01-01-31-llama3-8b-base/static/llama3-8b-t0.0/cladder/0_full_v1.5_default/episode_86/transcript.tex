	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%. Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether the chance of lirg is smaller when observing jyka, we need to calculate the probability of lirg given jyka (P(lirg|jyka)) and compare it to the overall probability of lirg (P(lirg)).\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(lirg|jyka):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(lirg|jyka) = P(jyka and lirg) / P(jyka)\\ \tt = 12% / 14%\\ \tt = 0.8571 (or approximately 85.71%)\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's calculate the overall probability of lirg (P(lirg)) using the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(lirg) = P(not jyka and lirg) + P(jyka and lirg)\\ \tt = 72% + 12%\\ \tt = 84%\\ \tt \\ \tt Comparing P(lirg|jyka) (85.71%) to P(lirg) (84%), we can see that the probability of lirg is actually higher when observing jyka. This suggests that the presence of jyka is associated with an increased chance of lirg, rather than a decreased one.
