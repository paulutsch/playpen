The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can use the backdoor adjustment method to estimate the causal effect of zuph on uvzi.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the probability of uvzi for those who are not wibl and are not zuph (77%), and for those who are not wibl and are zuph (63%). The difference between these two probabilities is 14%.\n\nNext, we can calculate the probability of uvzi for those who are wibl and are not zuph (54%), and for those who are wibl and are zuph (76%). The difference between these two probabilities is 22%.\n\nHowever, since wibl has a direct effect on uvzi, we need to adjust for this confounding variable. We can use the backdoor adjustment formula to estimate the causal effect of zuph on uvzi.\n\nLet P(uvzi|wibl, zuph) be the probability of uvzi given wibl and zuph, P(uvzi|not wibl, zuph) be the probability of uvzi given not wibl and zuph, P(uvzi|wibl, not zuph) be the probability of uvzi given wibl and not zuph, and",
