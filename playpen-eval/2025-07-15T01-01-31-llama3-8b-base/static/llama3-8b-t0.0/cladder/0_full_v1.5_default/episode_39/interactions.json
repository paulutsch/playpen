The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size.\n2. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size.\n3. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%.\n4. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%.\n5. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.\n\nWe can use the potential outcomes framework to analyze this problem. Let's define two potential outcomes for each individual: having large feet (L) and having small feet (S). We can then use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of large feet.\n\nLet's denote the probability of going to a tanning salon as P(T) = 0.1, and the probability of not going to a tanning salon as P(¬T) = 0.9. We also know that the probability of large feet given no tanning salon treatment is P(L|¬T) = 0.13, and the probability of large feet given tanning salon treatment is P(L|T) = 0.7.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can calculate the overall probability of large feet as follows:\n\nP",
