	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Swoy has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. For those who are not rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 46%. For those who are not rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 41%. For those who are rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 66%. For those who are rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 60%. For those who are not rixq, the probability of zuph is 61%. For those who are rixq, the probability of zuph is 34%. For those who are rixq, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not rixq?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of counterfactuals and potential outcomes. We are asked to compare the probability of xevu for an individual who is rixq with the probability of xevu for the same individual if they were not rixq.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(xevu | rixq, zuph) = 0.6 (probability of xevu given rixq and zuph)\\ \tt - P(xevu | rixq, not zuph) = 0.66 (probability of xevu given rixq and not zuph)\\ \tt - P(xevu | not rixq, zuph) = 0.41 (probability of xevu given not rixq and zuph)\\ \tt - P(xevu | not rixq, not zuph) = 0.46 (probability of xevu given not rixq and not zuph)\\ \tt - P(zuph | rixq) = 0.34 (probability of zuph given rixq)\\ \tt - P(zuph | not rixq) = 0.61 (probability of zuph given not rixq)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are interested in the probability of xevu for an individual who is rixq, but we want to compare it with
