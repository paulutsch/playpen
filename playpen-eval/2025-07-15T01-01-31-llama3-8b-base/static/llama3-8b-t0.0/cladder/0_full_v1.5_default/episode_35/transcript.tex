	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 35%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, having visited England will not increase the chance of employee being fired.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the concept of causal mediation analysis. We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has not visited England is 35%.\\ \tt 2. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has visited England is 66%.\\ \tt 3. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee is 28%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the formula for causal mediation analysis to estimate the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being fired. Let's denote the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has not visited England as P(Y=1|D=1, E=0), the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has visited England as P(Y=1|D=1, E=1), and the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee as P(Y=1|D=1).\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the following formula to estimate the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being fired:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Y=1|D=1, E=1) - P(Y=1|D=1, E=0) = 66% - 35% = 31%\\ \tt \\ \tt However, this is not the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being
