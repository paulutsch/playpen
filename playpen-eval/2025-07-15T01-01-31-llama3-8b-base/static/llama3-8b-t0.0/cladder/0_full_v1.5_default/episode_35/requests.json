Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 35%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%.

We are given the following information:\n\n1. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has not visited England is 35%.\n2. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has visited England is 66%.\n3. The probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee is 28%.\n\nWe can use the formula for causal mediation analysis to estimate the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being fired. Let's denote the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has not visited England as P(Y=1|D=1, E=0), the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee and has visited England as P(Y=1|D=1, E=1), and the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has fired the employee as P(Y=1|D=1).\n\nWe can use the following formula to estimate the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being fired:\n\nP(Y=1|D=1, E=1) - P(Y=1|D=1, E=0) = 66% - 35% = 31%\n\nHowever, this is not the effect of visiting England on the probability of employee being",
