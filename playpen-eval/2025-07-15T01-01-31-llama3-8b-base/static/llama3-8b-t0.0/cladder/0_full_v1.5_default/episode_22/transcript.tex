	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Will waking up late increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt Although waking up late is associated with a higher probability of arriving to school on time (78% vs 46%), this does not necessarily imply that waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time. \\ \tt \\ \tt To assess the causal effect of waking up late on arriving to school on time, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of traffic. The probability of arriving to school on time may be higher when Alice wakes up late because traffic conditions are also favorable on those days, not because waking up late has a direct causal effect on arriving to school on time.\\ \tt \\ \tt In other words, the observed association between waking up late and arriving to school on time may be due to the correlation between waking up late and favorable traffic conditions, rather than a direct causal effect of waking up late on arriving to school on time. Therefore, without controlling for traffic, we cannot conclude that waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time.
