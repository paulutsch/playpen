Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Will waking up late increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of arriving to school on time may be higher when Alice wakes up late because traffic conditions are also favorable on those days, not because waking up late has a direct causal effect on arriving to school on time.\n\nIn other words, the observed association between waking up late and arriving to school on time may be due to the correlation between waking up late and favorable traffic conditions, rather than a direct causal effect of waking up late on arriving to school on time. Therefore, without controlling for traffic, we cannot conclude that waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time.<|eot_id|>",
