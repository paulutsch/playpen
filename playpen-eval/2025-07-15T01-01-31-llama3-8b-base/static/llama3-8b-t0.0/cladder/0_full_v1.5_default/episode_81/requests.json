The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 3%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 78%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 2%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, we can use the given probabilities to infer the relationship between Rixq and Xevu.\n\nLet's denote the probability of Xevu as P(Xevu) and the probability of Rixq as P(Rixq) = 0.03.\n\nWe are given that P(¬Rixq, Xevu) = 0.78 and P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.02.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(Xevu) as:\n\nP(Xevu) = P(Xevu | Rixq) * P(Rixq) + P(Xevu | ¬Rixq) * P(¬Rixq)\n\nWe know that P(Rixq) = 0.03 and P(¬Rixq) = 1 - P(Rixq) = 0.97.\n\nWe can rewrite P(Xevu) as:\n\n",
