The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 91%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 71%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 69%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 43%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 28%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 20%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 57%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 70%. The overall probability of smoker is 8%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(long lifespan | normal weight, no diabetes) = 91%\n- P(long lifespan | normal weight, diabetes) = 71%\n- P(long lifespan | obese, no diabetes) = 69%\n- P(long lifespan | obese, diabetes) = 43%\n\nWe are also given the probabilities of having diabetes for different groups:\n\n- P(diabetes | normal weight, nonsmoker) = 28%\n- P(diabetes | normal weight, smoker) = 20%\n- P(diabetes | obese, nonsmoker) = 57%\n- P(diabetes | obese, smoker) = 70%\n\nWe are asked to disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, which means we are interested in the direct effect of obesity on lifespan, excluding the effect of diabetes.\n\nTo answer this question, we can use the concept of counterfactuals. We need to compare the probability of long lifespan for obese individuals with the probability of long lifespan for normal weight individuals, while holding the diabetes status constant.\n\nLet's consider two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Obese individuals without diabetes\n- P(long lifespan | obese, no diabetes) = 69%\n\nScenario 2: Normal weight individuals without diabetes\n- P(long lifespan | normal weight, no diabetes) =",
