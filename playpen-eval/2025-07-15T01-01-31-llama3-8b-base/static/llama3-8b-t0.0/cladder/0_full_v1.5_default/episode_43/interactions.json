The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 77%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 45%. Will speaking english decrease the chance of long lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We also have two observed outcomes: the probability of long lifespan for people who do not speak English (77%) and the probability of long lifespan for people who speak English (45%).\n\nThe key to this problem is to recognize that the relationship between speaking English (E) and lifespan (L) is confounded by the variable diabetes (D). Smoking (S) is an unobserved variable that affects both diabetes (D) and lifespan (L), and it is also related to the ability to speak English (E). \n\nWe can represent this relationship using a directed acyclic graph (DAG):\n\nE -> D\nS -> D\nS -> E\nD -> L\n\nIn this graph, the arrow represents a direct causal relationship between the variables. We can see that smoking (S) is a common cause of both diabetes (D) and the ability to speak English (E), and it also affects lifespan (L) directly.\n\nNow, let's consider the observed outcomes. The probability of long lifespan for people who do not speak English is 77%, and the probability of long lifespan for people who speak English is 45%.
