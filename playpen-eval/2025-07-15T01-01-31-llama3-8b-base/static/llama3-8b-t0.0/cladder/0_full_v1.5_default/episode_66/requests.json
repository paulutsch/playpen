Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Rixq → zuph\n2. Rixq → xevu\n3. Swoy → zuph\n4. Swoy → xevu\n5. zuph → xevu\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(Rixq) = 0.7\n2. P(¬Rixq, Xevu) = 0.06\n3. P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe can calculate the probability of xevu given rixq (P(Xevu|Rixq)) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Xevu|Rixq) = P(Xevu|Rixq, Swoy) * P(Swoy|Rixq) + P(Xevu|Rixq, ¬Swoy) * P(¬Swoy|Rixq)\n\nHowever, we are not given the conditional probabilities P(Swoy|Rixq) and P(¬Swoy|Rixq). But we can use the law of total probability to express P(Xevu|Rixq) in terms of the given probabilities:\n\nP(Xevu|Rixq) = P(Xevu|Rix",
