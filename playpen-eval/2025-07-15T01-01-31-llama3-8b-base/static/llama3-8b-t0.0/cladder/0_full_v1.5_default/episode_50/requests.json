The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To assess this, we need to consider the probability distributions of the variables involved.\n\nGiven:\n- P(B) = 0.01 (probability of having a brother)\n- P(¬B ∧ AC) = 0.64 (probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm)\n- P(B ∧ AC) = 0.00 (probability of having a brother and ringing alarm)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of ringing alarm (AC) given having a brother (B) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(AC|B) = P(B ∧ AC) / P(B)\n= 0.00 / 0.01\n= 0.00\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the probability of ringing alarm (AC) given not having a brother (¬B):\n\nP(AC|¬B) = P(¬B ∧ AC) / P(¬B)\n= 0.64 / (1 - 0.01)\n= 0.64 / 0.99\n= 0.6465\n\nComparing the two probabilities, we see that P",
