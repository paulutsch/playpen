The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. The overall probability of jyka is 25%. The probability of not jyka and kwox is 71%. The probability of jyka and kwox is 24%. Is the chance of kwox smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given that P(J) = 0.25, P(¬J ∧ K) = 0.71, and P(J ∧ K) = 0.24.\n\nWe know that Jyka has a direct effect on yupt, and yupt has a direct effect on kwox. This implies that the effect of Jyka on kwox is mediated by yupt. To assess the effect of Jyka on kwox, we need to consider the conditional probability of kwox given jyka, P(K|J).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(K|J) as:\n\nP(K|J) = P(K|J ∧ Y) \\* P(Y|J) + P(K|¬J ∧ Y) \\* P(¬Y|J)\n\nWe are given that P(J ∧ K) = 0.24 and P(¬J ∧ K) = 0.71. We can use these values to calculate P(K|J) as follows:\n\nP(K|J) = P(K|J ∧ Y) \\* P(Y|",
