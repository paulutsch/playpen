Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. The overall probability of jyka is 25%. The probability of not jyka and kwox is 71%. The probability of jyka and kwox is 24%.

We are given that P(J) = 0.25, P(¬J ∧ K) = 0.71, and P(J ∧ K) = 0.24.\n\nWe know that Jyka has a direct effect on yupt, and yupt has a direct effect on kwox. This implies that the effect of Jyka on kwox is mediated by yupt. To assess the effect of Jyka on kwox, we need to consider the conditional probability of kwox given jyka, P(K|J).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(K|J) as:\n\nP(K|J) = P(K|J ∧ Y) \\* P(Y|J) + P(K|¬J ∧ Y) \\* P(¬Y|J)\n\nWe are given that P(J ∧ K) = 0.24 and P(¬J ∧ K) = 0.71. We can use these values to calculate P(K|J) as follows:\n\nP(K|J) = P(K|J ∧ Y) \\* P(Y|",
