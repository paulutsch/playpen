The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. We know that xevo or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is not tijv. Would an individual is gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is a classic example of a common cause problem.\n\nNow, we are given that the individual is not Tijv. We want to know whether the individual would be Gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the counterfactual: \"What would happen if the individual was not Xevo?\" \n\nUsing the backdoor criterion, we can block the direct effect of Xevo on Gyzp by conditioning on Tijv. However, since we know that the individual is not Tijv, we cannot use Tijv as a backdoor variable.\n\nIn this case, we can use the common effect principle, which states that if Xevo and Tijv are common causes of Gyzp, then the effect of Xevo on Gyzp is the same as the effect of Tijv on Gyzp.\n\nSince the individual is not Tijv, we can conclude that the individual would",
