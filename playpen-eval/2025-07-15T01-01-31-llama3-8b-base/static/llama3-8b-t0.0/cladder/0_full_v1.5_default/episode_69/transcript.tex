	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%. Is the chance of kwoz smaller when observing kwox?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the backdoor criterion. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given the conditions, we have the following causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Muvy → kwox and kwoz\\ \tt - kwox → swoq\\ \tt - swoq → kwoz\\ \tt \\ \tt Since Muvy is unobserved, it acts as a confounding variable. The probability of kwoz is influenced by both Muvy and kwox. To determine the effect of observing kwox on the probability of kwoz, we need to consider the backdoor paths from kwox to kwoz.\\ \tt \\ \tt The backdoor path from kwox to kwoz is: kwox → swoq → kwoz. This path is open, meaning that observing kwox can affect the probability of kwoz through this path.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, we also need to consider the effect of Muvy on both kwox and kwoz. Since Muvy is a common cause of both kwox and kwoz, it creates a confounding effect. The probability of kwoz is influenced by both Muvy and kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the effect of observing kwox on the probability of kwoz, we can use the formula for the backdoor adjustment:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(kwoz | kwox) = P(kwoz) + P(k
