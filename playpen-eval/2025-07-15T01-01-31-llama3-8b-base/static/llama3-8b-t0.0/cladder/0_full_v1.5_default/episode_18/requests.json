Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The probability of a manager signing the termination letter is 35%.\n2. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%.\n3. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of employee being fired by considering two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Manager signs the termination letter (35% probability)\n  - In this case, the probability of employee being fired is 42%.\n- Scenario 2: Manager doesn't sign the termination letter (65% probability, since 100% - 35% = 65%)\n  - In this case, the probability of employee being fired is 76%.\n\nTo find the overall probability of employee being fired, we need to calculate the weighted average of these two scenarios:\n\nOverall probability of employee being fired = (Probability of manager signing the termination letter * Probability of employee being fired in this scenario) + (Probability of manager not signing the termination letter * Probability of employee being fired in this scenario)\n= (0.35 * 0.42) + (0.65 * 0.76)\n= 0.147 + 0.494\n= 0.641\n\nNow, let's compare this overall probability of employee being fired (0.641) with the probability of",
