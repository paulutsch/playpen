The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on zory and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 34%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 64%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 28%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

P(zuph) = 34%\n2. P(not zuph and glimx) = 64%\n3. P(zuph and glimx) = 28%\n\nFrom the given information, we can calculate the unconditional probability of glimx as follows:\n\nP(glimx) = P(zuph and glimx) + P(not zuph and glimx)\n= 28% + 64%\n= 92%\n\nNow, we need to calculate the conditional probability of glimx given zuph. We can use the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(glimx|zuph) = P(zuph and glimx) / P(zuph)\n= 28% / 34%\n= 82.35%\n\nComparing the conditional probability of glimx given zuph (82.35%) to the unconditional probability of glimx (92%), we can see that the chance of glimx is actually larger when observing zuph.
