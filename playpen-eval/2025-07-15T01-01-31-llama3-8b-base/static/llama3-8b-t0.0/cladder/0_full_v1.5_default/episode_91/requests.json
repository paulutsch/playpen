P(zuph) = 34%\n2. P(not zuph and glimx) = 64%\n3. P(zuph and glimx) = 28%\n\nFrom the given information, we can calculate the unconditional probability of glimx as follows:\n\nP(glimx) = P(zuph and glimx) + P(not zuph and glimx)\n= 28% + 64%\n= 92%\n\nNow, we need to calculate the conditional probability of glimx given zuph. We can use the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(glimx|zuph) = P(zuph and glimx) / P(zuph)\n= 28% / 34%\n= 82.35%\n\nComparing the conditional probability of glimx given zuph (82.35%) to the unconditional probability of glimx (92%), we can see that the chance of glimx is actually larger when observing zuph. Therefore, the answer is No.<|eot_id|>",
