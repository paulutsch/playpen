The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The probability of alarm set by husband is 8%.\n2. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%.\n3. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%.\n\nWe want to compare the overall probability of ringing alarm (P(Ringing Alarm)) to the overall probability of silent alarm (P(Silent Alarm)).\n\nTo calculate P(Ringing Alarm), we need to consider two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Husband sets the alarm. In this case, the probability of ringing alarm is 16% (P(Ringing Alarm | Set Alarm)).\n- Scenario 2: Husband doesn't set the alarm. In this case, the probability of ringing alarm is 75% (P(Ringing Alarm | Not Set Alarm)).\n\nSince the probability of alarm set by husband is 8%, we can calculate the weighted average of the two scenarios:\n\nP(Ringing Alarm) = P(Set Alarm) \\* P(Ringing Alarm | Set Alarm) + P(Not Set Alarm) \\* P(Ringing Alarm | Not Set Alarm)\n= 0.08 \\* 0.16 + (1 - 0.08) \\* 0.75\n=",
