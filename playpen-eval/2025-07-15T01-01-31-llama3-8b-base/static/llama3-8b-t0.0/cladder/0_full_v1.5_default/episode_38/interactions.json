The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school case by case according to traffic. Method 2: We look directly at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. To understand how solar eclipse affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

When we use Method 2, we are directly examining the correlation between solar eclipse and Alice arriving to school, which may be biased due to the confounding effect of traffic.\n\nHowever, Method 1, which examines the correlation between solar eclipse and Alice arriving to school case by case according to traffic, is actually a form of stratification or matching, which can help to control for the confounding effect of traffic. By stratifying the data according to traffic, we can estimate the effect of solar eclipse on Alice arriving to school within each stratum, which can provide a more accurate estimate of the causal effect.\n\nIn fact, Method 1 is an example of a technique called \"instrumental variable analysis\" or \"regression discontinuity design\" (RDD), which can be used to estimate causal effects in the presence of confounding variables. By using traffic as a stratification variable, we are essentially using it as an instrumental variable, which can help to identify the causal effect of solar eclipse on Alice arriving to school.\n\nTherefore, while Method 2 may be a more straightforward approach, Method 1 is actually a more correct approach in this scenario, as it allows us to control for the confounding effect of traffic and estimate the causal effect of solar",
