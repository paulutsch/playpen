The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 15%. For those who are not zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 50%. For those who are zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 32%. For those who are zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 85%. The overall probability of zuph is 84%. Will rixq increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(xevu | not zuph, not rixq) = 15%\n- P(xevu | not zuph, rixq) = 50%\n- P(xevu | zuph, not rixq) = 32%\n- P(xevu | zuph, rixq) = 85%\n- P(zuph) = 84%\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of xevu as follows:\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu | not zuph, not rixq) * P(not zuph, not rixq) + P(xevu | not zuph, rixq) * P(not zuph, rixq) + P(xevu | zuph, not rixq) * P(zuph, not rixq) + P(xevu | zuph, rixq) * P(zuph, rixq)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the joint probabilities of zuph and rixq. We can do this by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(zuph, rixq) = P(zuph | rixq) * P(rixq)\nSince",
