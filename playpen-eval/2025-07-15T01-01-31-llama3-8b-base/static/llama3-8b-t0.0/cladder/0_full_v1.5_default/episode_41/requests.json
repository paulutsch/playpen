Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can use the law of total probability to calculate this:\n\nP(B|E) = P(B ∩ E) / P(E)\n\nWe are given:\n- P(B ∩ E) = 3% (probability of college degree or higher and black hair)\n- P(E) = 6% (probability of college degree or higher)\n\nP(B|E) = 3% / 6% = 0.5\n\nNow, let's compare this with the overall probability of black hair (P(B)). We are given:\n- P(B ∩ HS) = 25% (probability of high school degree or lower and black hair)\n\nSince the only other possible combination is college degree or higher and black hair (3%), we can calculate the overall probability of black hair as follows:\n\nP(B) = P",
