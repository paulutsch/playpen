	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the backdoor criterion. \\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we have the following variables and their relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Ability to speak English (A)\\ \tt - Diabetes (D)\\ \tt - Lifespan (L)\\ \tt - Smoking (S)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(L|A=0) = 0.7 (probability of long lifespan for people who do not speak English)\\ \tt - P(L|A=1) = 0.38 (probability of long lifespan for people who speak English)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are asked to determine whether it would be less likely to see a long lifespan if the person did not speak English, given that they speak English.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of smoking (S). Since smoking is unobserved, we cannot directly measure its effect on lifespan. However, we know that smoking has a direct effect on both diabetes (D) and lifespan (L).\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the backdoor criterion, we can identify a potential confounding path: A → D ← S → L. This path suggests that the effect of speaking English (A) on lifespan (L) may be confounded by smoking (S).\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether it would be less likely to see a long lifespan if the person did not speak English, we need to consider the potential effect of smoking on lifespan for people who speak English.
