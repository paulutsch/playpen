The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since smoking is unobserved, we cannot directly measure its effect on lifespan. However, we know that smoking has a direct effect on both diabetes (D) and lifespan (L).\n\nUsing the backdoor criterion, we can identify a potential confounding path: A → D ← S → L. This path suggests that the effect of speaking English (A) on lifespan (L) may be confounded by smoking (S).\n\nTo determine whether it would be less likely to see a long lifespan if the person did not speak English, we need to consider the potential effect of smoking on lifespan for people who speak English.",
