We can do this by considering two groups: those who are kwox and those who are not kwox.\n\nFor those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. Since the overall probability of kwox is 1%, the probability of not being kwox is 99%. Therefore, the probability of not being kwox and having kwoz is 0.99 * 0.47 = 0.4663.\n\nFor those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Since the overall probability of kwox is 1%, the probability of being kwox and having kwoz is 0.01 * 0.92 = 0.0092.\n\nTo find the overall probability of kwoz, we add the probabilities of these two groups: 0.4663 + 0.0092 = 0.4755.\n\nSince 0.4755 is greater than 0.5, kwoz is more likely than not kwoz overall.<|eot_id|>",
