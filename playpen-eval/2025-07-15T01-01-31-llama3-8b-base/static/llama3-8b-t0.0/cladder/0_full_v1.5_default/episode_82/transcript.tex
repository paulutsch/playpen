	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kwox has a direct effect on kwoz. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. The overall probability of kwox is 1%. For those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. For those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Is kwoz less likely than not kwoz overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether kwoz is less likely than not kwoz overall, we need to calculate the overall probability of kwoz. We can do this by considering two groups: those who are kwox and those who are not kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt For those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. Since the overall probability of kwox is 1%, the probability of not being kwox is 99%. Therefore, the probability of not being kwox and having kwoz is 0.99 * 0.47 = 0.4663.\\ \tt \\ \tt For those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Since the overall probability of kwox is 1%, the probability of being kwox and having kwoz is 0.01 * 0.92 = 0.0092.\\ \tt \\ \tt To find the overall probability of kwoz, we add the probabilities of these two groups: 0.4663 + 0.0092 = 0.4755.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since 0.4755 is greater than 0.5, kwoz is more likely than not kwoz overall.
