	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the causal diagram. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given the conditions:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Unobserved confounders (U) has a direct effect on education level (E) and foot size (F).\\ \tt - Proximity to a college (P) has a direct effect on education level (E).\\ \tt - Education level (E) has a direct effect on foot size (F).\\ \tt - Unobserved confounders (U) is unobserved.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can represent this causal diagram as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt U -> E\\ \tt U -> F\\ \tt P -> E\\ \tt E -> F\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(E ≥ college) = 0.47\\ \tt - P(E ≤ high school, F = large) = 0.32\\ \tt - P(E ≥ college, F = large) = 0.10\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine if the chance of large feet is smaller when observing college degree or higher, we need to compare the conditional probability of large feet given college degree or higher (P(F = large | E ≥ college)) with the unconditional probability of large feet (P(F = large)).\\ \tt \\ \tt However, we cannot directly calculate these probabilities from the given information. Instead, we can use the concept of causal diagrams and the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect of interest.\\ \tt \\ \tt The backdoor criterion states that a path from the cause (E ≥ college) to the effect (F
