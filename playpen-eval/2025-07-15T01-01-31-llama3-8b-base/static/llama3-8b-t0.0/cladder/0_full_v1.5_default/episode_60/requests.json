The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Instead, we can use the concept of causal diagrams and the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect of interest.\n\nThe backdoor criterion states that a path from the cause (E ≥ college) to the effect (F",
