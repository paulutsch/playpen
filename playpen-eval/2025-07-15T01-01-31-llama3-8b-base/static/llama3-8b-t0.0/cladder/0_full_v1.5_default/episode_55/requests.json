Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To do this, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(R=1|W=0) = P(R=1 and W=0) / P(W=0)\n\nHowever, we don't have P(R=1 and W=0) directly. We can use the law of total probability again to find P(R=1 and W=0):\n\nP(R=1 and W=0) = P(R=1) * P(W=0|R=1)\n\nWe can find P(R=1) by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(R=1) = P(R=1 and W=1) + P(R=1 and W",
