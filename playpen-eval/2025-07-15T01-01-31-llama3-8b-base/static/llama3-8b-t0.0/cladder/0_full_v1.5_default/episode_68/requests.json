Since P(not rixq) = 1 - P(rixq) = 1 - 40% = 60%, we can use the formula for conditional probability to find P(xevu and not rixq):\n\nP(xevu and not rixq) = P(not rixq and xevu) / P(not rixq)\n= 9% / 60%\n= 15%\n\nNow we can calculate P(xevu):\n\nP(xevu) = 22% + 15%\n= 37%\n\nTo calculate P(xevu|rixq), we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(xevu|rixq) = P(xevu and rixq) / P(rixq)\n= 22% / 40%\n= ",
