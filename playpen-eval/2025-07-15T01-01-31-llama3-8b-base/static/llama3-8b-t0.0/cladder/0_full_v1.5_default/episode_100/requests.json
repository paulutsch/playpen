Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. We know that jyka causes not zuph and zory. zuph and zory causes glimx. We observed an individual is jyka.

We are asked to consider a counterfactual scenario where Zuph is instead not Zuph (i.e., Zuph is absent).\n\nTo determine the effect of this counterfactual scenario on Glimx, we need to consider the causal relationships between the variables. Since Zuph and Zory are both causes of Glimx, and Jyka causes both Zuph and Zory, we can use the concept of causal mediation to analyze the effect of Zuph on Glimx.\n\nIn this case, the causal effect of Jyka on Glimx is mediated by both Zuph and Zory. If Zuph is absent, the causal effect of Jyka on Glimx would still be mediated by Zory, as well as any other direct effects of Jyka on Glimx (if any).\n\nHowever, the absence of Zuph would not affect the causal effect of Jyka on Glimx, because the causal relationship between Jyka and Glimx is not entirely mediated by Zuph.
