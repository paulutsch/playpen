	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, gene does not positively affect lung cancer through smoking.\\ \tt \\ \tt To assess this, we can use the backdoor criterion, which is a method for identifying causal relationships in the presence of confounding variables. We need to check if the effect of the gene on lung cancer through smoking is unconfounded.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's define the variables:\\ \tt \\ \tt - G: Gene (smoking or nonsmoking)\\ \tt - S: Smoking status (smoker or nonsmoker)\\ \tt - L: Lung cancer status (yes or no)\\ \tt - P: Pollution level (high or low)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(L|G=NS, S=NS) = 0.56\\ \tt - P(L|G=NS, S=S) = 0.42\\ \tt - P(L|G=S, S=NS) = 0.60\\ \tt - P(L|G=S, S=S) = 0.40\\ \tt - P(S|G=NS, P=Low) = 0.76\\ \tt - P(S|G=NS, P=High) = 0.48\\ \tt - P(S|G=S, P=Low) = 0.46\\ \tt - P(S|G=S, P=High) = 0.21\\ \tt - P(P=High) = 0.41\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to estimate the effect of the gene on lung cancer through smoking, which can be represented as P(L|G, S).
