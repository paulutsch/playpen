The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

P → S (Parents' intelligence affects parents' social status)\n2. P → C (Parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence)\n3. S → C (Parents' social status affects child's intelligence)\n4. Other unobserved factors → S and C (Other unobserved factors affect both parents' social status and child's intelligence)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(P) = 0.15 (probability of intelligent parents)\n- P(C|P=0, C=1) = 0.54 (probability of intelligent child given unintelligent parents)\n- P(P=1, C=1) = 0.04 (probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child)\n\nTo determine whether the chance of an intelligent child is smaller when observing intelligent parents, we need to calculate the probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents, P(C|P=1). \n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(C|P=1) as:\n\nP(C|P",
