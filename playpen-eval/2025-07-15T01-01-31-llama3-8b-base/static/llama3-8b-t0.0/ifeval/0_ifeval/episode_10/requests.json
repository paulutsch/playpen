Task Summary**\n\n* **Task ID:** RTCS-001\n* **Task Description:** Develop a real-time chat system for the company's internal communication platform, allowing employees to communicate with each other in real-time.\n* **Task Owner:** John Doe (Software Engineer)\n* **Task Priority:** High\n* **Task Status:** In Progress\n\n***\n\n**Part 2. Motivation**\n\nThe company's internal communication platform is currently limited to email and asynchronous messaging. This makes it difficult for employees to communicate with each other in real-time, leading to delays and inefficiencies. The implementation of a real-time chat system will improve communication and collaboration among employees, leading to increased productivity and better decision-making.\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n* Real-time messaging\n* Group chat functionality\n* File sharing and transfer\n* User authentication and authorization\n* Integration with existing company directory\n\n***\n\n**Part 3. Milestone Objectives**\n\nThe task will be completed in three milestones:\n\n**Milestone 1: Requirements Gathering and Design (Due Date: 2024-07-31)**\n\n* Gather requirements from stakeholders and employees\n* Design the chat system architecture and user interface\n* Create a detailed specification document\n\n**Milestone 2: Frontend Development (Due Date: 2024-08-14)**\n\n* Develop the chat system frontend using React and WebSockets\n* Implement real-time messaging and group chat functionality\n* Integrate with existing company directory\n\n**Milestone 3: Backend Development and Testing (Due Date: 2024-08-28)**\n\n* Develop the chat system backend using Node.js and Express\n* Implement user authentication and authorization\n* Test the chat system for bugs and performance issues\n\n***\n\n**Part 4. Timeline**\n\nThe task is expected to be completed within 6 weeks. The timeline is as follows:\n\n| Week | Task | Due Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Requirements gathering and design | 2024-07-31 |\n| 2-3 | Frontend development | 2024-08-14 |\n| 4-5 | Backend development and testing | 2024-08-28 |\n| 6 | Final testing and deployment | 2024-09-04 |\n\n***\n\n**Part 5. Doc History**\n\n* **Initial Version:** 2024-07-26 (John Doe)\n* **Revision 1:** 2024-07-28 (John Doe) - Added detailed specification document\n* **Revision 2:** 2024-08-01 (John Doe) - Updated timeline and milestone objectives\n\nNote: This is a sample planning document and should be adapted to the specific needs of the task and project.<|eot_id|>",
