This is because heavier axles apply greater loads to the road surface, causing more deformation and wear. As a result, roads may experience more frequent potholes, cracks, and other forms of deterioration. This can ultimately lead to higher maintenance costs and a shorter lifespan for the road.<|eot_id|>",
