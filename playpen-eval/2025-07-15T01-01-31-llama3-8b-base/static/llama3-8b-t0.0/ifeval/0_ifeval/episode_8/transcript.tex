	 "**The Great Dino-Mite Extinction: A Totally Not Scientific Explanation**"\\ \tt \\ \tt "Ah, the dinosaurs - those lovable, lumbering creatures that ruled the Earth for millions of years. But what really led to their demise? Was it a massive asteroid impact? A volcanic eruption? No, no, no. It was something much more... ridiculous. Here are the top 8 reasons why the dinosaurs went extinct:\\ \tt \\ \tt * This is bullet 1: **They were all trying to start a boy band**. Yes, you read that right. The dinosaurs were so obsessed with becoming the next big thing in music that they spent all their time practicing their harmonies and perfecting their dance moves. Unfortunately, their lack of focus on, say, not being extinct, led to their downfall.\\ \tt * This is bullet 2: **They were allergic to feathers**. It's a little-known fact that many dinosaurs had feathers, but what's not well-known is that they were all severely allergic to them. The constant itching and sneezing led to a mass exodus of dino-sufferers, and before long, the species was extinct.\\ \tt * This is bullet 3: **They were all competing in a giant game of 'Dino-Mite'**. This popular dino-game involved running around, stomping on things, and trying to be the last one standing. Unfortunately, the game got a bit out of hand, and the dinosaurs all ended up extinct.\\ \tt * This is bullet 4: **They were all trying to break the world record for most consecutive hours spent watching TV**. The dinosaurs were so addicted to their favorite shows (we hear 'Dino-Mite' was a hit) that they forgot to eat, sleep, and, you know, not be extinct.\\ \tt * This is bullet 5: **They were all secretly ninjas**. It's true! The dinosaurs were all stealthy ninjas, but their love of stealth led to a series of unfortunate accidents, including getting stuck in tiny spaces and tripping over their own feet.\\ \tt * This is bullet 6: **They were all trying to start a giant game of 'Dino-Hide-and-Seek'**. This game involved hiding behind trees, under rocks, and in other hard-to-reach places. Unfortunately, the game got a bit out of hand, and the dinosaurs all ended up extinct.\\ \tt * This is bullet 7: **They were all competing in a giant baking competition**. The dinosaurs were so obsessed with baking the perfect cake that they forgot to, you know, not be extinct.\\ \tt * This is bullet 8: **They were all trying to break the world record for most consecutive hours spent playing video games**. The dinosaurs were so addicted to their favorite games (we hear 'Dino-Mite' was a hit) that they forgot to eat, sleep, and, you know, not be extinct.\\ \tt \\ \tt There you have it - the totally-not-scientific explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs. Who needs facts and evidence when you have a good story?"
