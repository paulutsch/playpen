A more common way to express the idea would be:\n\nWerner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht sehr begabt.\n\nThe word \"begabt\" implies a lack of natural ability or talent, which is closer to the original meaning of \"not very smart\". \n\nThe original sentence in English is a bit informal and might be considered a bit blunt or even slightly derogatory. In German, the translation \"nicht sehr begabt\" is also somewhat informal, but it's a more common way to express the idea in everyday conversation. If you want to be more polite or formal, you could use a phrase like \"nicht sehr geistig begabt\" or \"nicht sehr leistungsfähig\", but these phrases might sound a bit more awkward or forced.<|eot_id|>",
