	 **Day 1: Arrival and Acclimation**\\ \tt \\ \tt The students arrive at the campus, exhausted from their long journey. To wake them up, they're treated to a surprise breakfast of "Campus Cereal" - a mix of Froot Loops, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and a dash of mystery cereal that's been sitting in the back of the pantry since the Clinton administration. After fueling up, they head to the "Extreme Lounge" for a game of "Who Can Eat the Most Pizza in One Sitting." The winner gets a prize: a year's supply of ramen noodles.\\ \tt \\ \tt *** \\ \tt \\ \tt **Day 2: Campus Shenanigans**\\ \tt \\ \tt The students start the day with a thrilling game of "Capture the Flag...of the Cafeteria." They have to sneak into the cafeteria, grab a tray, and make a break for it without getting caught by the cafeteria staff. The team that successfully captures the most flags wins. Afterward, they head to the "Innovation Station" for a workshop on "The Art of Napping in Class." They learn the ancient techniques of the "Power Nap," the "Sneaky Snooze," and the "Art of Falling Asleep with Your Eyes Open."\\ \tt \\ \tt *** \\ \tt \\ \tt **Day 3: The Great Escape**\\ \tt \\ \tt The students are given a challenge: escape the campus without getting caught by the "Campus Cops" (aka the administrators). They have to navigate through a maze of buildings, avoid getting caught in the "Time-Warp Tunnel" (aka the library), and make it to the "Freedom Zone" (aka the parking lot) without getting caught. The team that successfully escapes wins a prize: a year's supply of free parking.\\ \tt \\ \tt *** \\ \tt \\ \tt **The Grand Finale**\\ \tt \\ \tt The students gather for a final feast of "Campus Cuisine" - a mix of leftover pizza, Chinese takeout, and a dash of mystery meat. They share stories of their adventures, and the winners of the challenges are awarded their prizes. As they depart, they're given a parting gift: a t-shirt that reads "I Survived [Campus Name] 3-Day Adventure." They leave with memories that will last a lifetime, and a newfound appreciation for the art of napping in class.
