          "content": "**Day 1: Arrival and Acclimation**\n\nThe students arrive at the campus, exhausted from their long journey. To wake them up, they're treated to a surprise breakfast of \"Campus Cereal\" - a mix of Froot Loops, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and a dash of mystery cereal that's been sitting in the back of the pantry since the Clinton administration. After fueling up, they head to the \"Extreme Lounge\" for a game of \"Who Can Eat the Most Pizza in One Sitting.\" The winner gets a prize: a year's supply of ramen noodles.\n\n*** \n\n**Day 2: Campus Shenanigans**\n\nThe students start the day with a thrilling game of \"Capture the Flag...of the Cafeteria.\" They have to sneak into the cafeteria, grab a tray, and make a break for it without getting caught by the cafeteria staff. The team that successfully captures the most flags wins. Afterward, they head to the \"Innovation Station\" for a workshop on \"The Art of Napping in Class.\" They learn the ancient techniques of the \"Power Nap,\" the \"Sneaky Snooze,\" and the \"Art of Falling Asleep with Your Eyes Open.\"\n\n*** \n\n**Day 3: The Great Escape**\n\nThe students are given a challenge: escape the campus without getting caught by the \"Campus Cops\" (aka the administrators). They have to navigate through a maze of buildings, avoid getting caught in the \"Time-Warp Tunnel\" (aka the library), and make it to the \"Freedom Zone\" (aka the parking lot) without getting caught. The team that successfully escapes wins a prize: a year's supply of free parking.\n\n*** \n\n**The Grand Finale**\n\nThe students gather for a final feast of \"Campus Cuisine\" - a mix of leftover pizza, Chinese takeout, and a dash of mystery meat. They share stories of their adventures, and the winners of the challenges are awarded their prizes. As they depart, they're given a parting gift: a t-shirt that reads \"I Survived [Campus Name] 3-Day Adventure.\" They leave with memories that will last a lifetime, and a newfound appreciation for the art of napping in class.",
