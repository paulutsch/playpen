I'm thrilled to apply for this position, mainly because I've heard the views of the Pacific Ocean are to die for (not literally, I'm not a fan of dying). \n\nAs a highly skilled and moderately caffeinated individual, I'm confident I can bring a spark of excitement to your team. My extensive experience in procrastination and binge-watching Netflix has given me a unique understanding of the importance of taking breaks and prioritizing self-care. I'm pretty sure this will translate well to your workplace, where I'll undoubtedly become the office morale expert.\n\nWhen I'm not perfecting my 'I'm a functioning member of society' face, I enjoy hiking, playing video games, and eating an entire pizza by myself (no judgments, please). I'm a quick learner, a team player, and a master of making dad jokes. If you're looking for someone who can bring a little bit of humor and a lot of heart to your team, I'm your guy.\n\nI've attached my resume, which I've carefully crafted to include all the relevant skills and experience you're looking for. Or, at the very least, it's a nice piece of paper with my name on it.\n\nThanks for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to chat with you and show you why I'm the perfect fit for this role.\n\nCheers,\nDarius\"\n\n\"Note: Please don't hold my love of pizza against me. I promise to bring in a variety of snacks for the team, including but not limited to: pizza, pizza rolls, and pizza-themed cookies.\"",
