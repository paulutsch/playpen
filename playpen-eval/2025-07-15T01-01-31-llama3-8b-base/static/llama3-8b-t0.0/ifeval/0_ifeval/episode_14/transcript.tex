	 I'm not aware of a well-known album called "Lilith." However, I can suggest a few possibilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Lilith by Tori Amos: Released in 2001, this album is a concept album that explores themes of femininity, mythology, and personal growth.\\ \tt 2. Lilith Fair: A music festival and tour that took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s, featuring a collection of female artists.\\ \tt \\ \tt If you're referring to one of these, here's a draft email:\\ \tt \\ \tt Subject: You have to listen to this album - Lilith\\ \tt \\ \tt Dear Luheng,\\ \tt \\ \tt I've been thinking about you and wanted to share something with you that I think you'll really enjoy. I've been listening to this album called "Lilith" by Tori Amos, and I think it's really special. The music is beautiful, and the themes of femininity and personal growth really resonate with me.\\ \tt \\ \tt I think you'll appreciate the depth and emotion that Tori Amos brings to her music. The album is a concept album, which means it tells a story, and I think you'll find it really engaging.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'd love to hear what you think of it! Let me know if you want to come over and listen to it together.\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]\\ \tt \\ \tt P.S. If you're interested in checking out more music from Tori Amos, I highly recommend her other albums, such as "Little Earthquakes" and "Boys for Pele".
