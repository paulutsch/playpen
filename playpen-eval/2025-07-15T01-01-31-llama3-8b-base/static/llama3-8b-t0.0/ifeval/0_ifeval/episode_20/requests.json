This will prevent water from flowing into the toilet bowl while you work.\n\n***\nStep 2: Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet by loosening the nut that holds it in place using an adjustable wrench. Once loose, you should be able to remove the supply line from the toilet.\n\n***\nStep 3: Remove the old toilet by breaking the wax ring that holds it to the floor. You can use a putty knife or a scraper to break the wax ring, then lift the toilet off the flange (the metal ring that holds the toilet in place).\n\n***\nStep 4: Inspect the flange for any old wax or debris and clean it thoroughly. If the flange is damaged, you may need to replace it before installing the new toilet.\n\n***\nStep 5: Apply a new wax ring to the flange, making sure it's centered and evenly spread. This will provide a watertight seal between the toilet and the floor.\n\nLet me know how it works. I can give you next steps when you finish all steps above.<|eot_id|>",
