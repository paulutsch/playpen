	 My brother is trying to install a new toilet in his bathroom. Could you give me details of how-to? You don't need to show all details -- just the first 5 steps for now. Separated them with "***", such as:\\ \tt Step 1: ......\\ \tt ***\\ \tt Step 2: ......\\ \tt ***\\ \tt ...\\ \tt \\ \tt End your whole response with the phrase "Let me know how it works.

	 Here are the first 5 steps for installing a new toilet:\\ \tt \\ \tt Step 1: Shut off the water supply to the toilet by locating the shut-off valve behind the toilet and turning it clockwise. This will prevent water from flowing into the toilet bowl while you work.\\ \tt \\ \tt ***\\ \tt Step 2: Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet by loosening the nut that holds it in place using an adjustable wrench. Once loose, you should be able to remove the supply line from the toilet.\\ \tt \\ \tt ***\\ \tt Step 3: Remove the old toilet by breaking the wax ring that holds it to the floor. You can use a putty knife or a scraper to break the wax ring, then lift the toilet off the flange (the metal ring that holds the toilet in place).\\ \tt \\ \tt ***\\ \tt Step 4: Inspect the flange for any old wax or debris and clean it thoroughly. If the flange is damaged, you may need to replace it before installing the new toilet.\\ \tt \\ \tt ***\\ \tt Step 5: Apply a new wax ring to the flange, making sure it's centered and evenly spread. This will provide a watertight seal between the toilet and the floor.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me know how it works. I can give you next steps when you finish all steps above.
