I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. As you know, we've been friends for a long time, and I value our relationship deeply. However, there are a few things that can trigger me and make me feel upset or defensive.\n\nFirstly, I'm extremely sensitive to criticism, especially when it's not constructive. If you have something to say, please make sure it's said in a kind and respectful manner. I'm always open to feedback and willing to learn, but harsh words can really hurt my feelings.\n\nSecondly, I get anxious when plans change at the last minute. I like to plan ahead and make sure I'm prepared for things, so when plans get cancelled or changed without warning, it can be really stressful for me.\n\nLastly, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and when things don't go according to plan, it can be really frustrating for me. I know it's not always possible to control everything, but I wish you could understand where I'm coming from.\n\nI know this might sound like a lot to take in, but I just wanted to be honest with you about what triggers me. I value our friendship so much, and I want us to be able to communicate openly and honestly with each other.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always here to talk and listen.\n\nThanks for being such an amazing friend.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\"\n\n\"<|eot_id|>",
