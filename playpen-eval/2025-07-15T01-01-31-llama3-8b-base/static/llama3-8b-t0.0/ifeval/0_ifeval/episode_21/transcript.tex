	 Poppy seeds are obtained from the opium poppy plant (Papaver somniferum) and have been used for various purposes for thousands of years. They are a rich source of nutrients, including protein, fiber, and minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc. The seeds are also a good source of healthy fats and contain antioxidants that help protect against cell damage and inflammation.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Poppy seeds are commonly used as a spice in baking and cooking. They have a nutty flavor and a delicate texture, making them a popular addition to bread, cakes, and pastries.

They can also be used as a topping for yogurt, oatmeal, or salads.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to their culinary uses, poppy seeds have been used in traditional medicine for centuries.
