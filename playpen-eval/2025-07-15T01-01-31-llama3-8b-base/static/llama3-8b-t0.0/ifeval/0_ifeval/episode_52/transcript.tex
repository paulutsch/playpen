	 **My Worst Nightmare**\\ \tt \\ \tt I'm writing this from my bedroom window where I've been hiding for the past hour. I was walking home from school when I noticed a guy following me. At first I thought it was just my imagination but as I kept looking back I saw him. He was wearing a black hoodie and sunglasses even though it's not sunny outside. I quickened my pace but he kept up with me. I tried to lose him in the crowd but he seemed to know exactly where I was going. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I've told my parents but they're not taking me seriously. I just want to feel safe again.
