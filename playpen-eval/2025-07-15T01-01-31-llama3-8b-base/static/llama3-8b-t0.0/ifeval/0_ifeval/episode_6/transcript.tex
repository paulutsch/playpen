	 To create a journal entry about stress management, I'll consider a hypothetical scenario. Let's say a college student, Alex, is feeling overwhelmed with upcoming exams and assignments. I'll write a journal entry from Alex's perspective, reflecting on their stress and potential strategies for managing it.\\ \tt \\ \tt Example journal entry:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Today, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of deadlines and exams. I realized that I've been putting off studying for my math test until the last minute, which is only adding to my stress. To manage my stress, I'm going to start breaking down my study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks, and also make time for self-care activities like meditation and exercise. I'm also going to reach out to my friends and family for support, as talking through my feelings with them always helps me feel better. By taking control of my schedule and prioritizing my well-being, I'm confident that I can tackle this challenging period and come out stronger on the other side."
