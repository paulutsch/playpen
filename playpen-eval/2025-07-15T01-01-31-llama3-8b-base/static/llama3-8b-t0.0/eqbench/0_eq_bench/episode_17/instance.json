I've heard tales of your cold-blooded poker face.\nEsther: And you must be Benny the Bluff. I've heard you're quite the charmer. \nBen: Guilty as charged, sweetheart. But don't let that fool you. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.\nEsther: I'm sure you do. But remember, Ben, this isn't a magic show. It's a game of skill. \nBen: And a little bit of luck, wouldn't you agree?\nEsther: Luck is for those who can't rely on their abilities.\nBen: Spoken like a true Ice Queen. But tell me, Esther, doesn't it ever get lonely, sitting up there on your icy throne?\nEsther: Better alone at the top than surrounded by fools at the bottom.\nBen: Ouch! That's a sharp tongue you've got there. \nEsther: It's served me well so far.\nBen: I can see that. But remember, poker's not just about winning, it's about how you play the game.\nEsther: And yet, it seems I'm the one raking in the chips.\nBen: For now, sweetheart, for now. But the night's still young.\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Esther would feel...\nThreatened\nUnfazed\nOverwhelmed\nJoyful\n\nGive each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\n\nYou must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\n\nThreatened: <score>\nUnfazed: <score>\nOverwhelmed: <score>\nJoyful: <score>\n\n\n[End of answer]\n\nRemember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion.
