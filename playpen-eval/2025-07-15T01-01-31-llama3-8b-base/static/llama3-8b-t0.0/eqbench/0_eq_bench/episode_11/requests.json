I've seen the Earth from a distance. It's round. \nJulian: That's what they want you to believe, Bennett.\nBennett: And who exactly are 'they'?\nJulian: The ones pulling the strings, the ones in power. \nBennett: You mean scientists? People dedicated to exploring and understanding our universe? \nJulian: No, the puppeteers. The ones who manipulate the scientists. \nBennett: You're suggesting a global conspiracy, Julian. That's a serious claim. \nJulian: And I stand by it. \nBennett: You're ignoring centuries of scientific evidence, Julian. \nJulian: I'm not ignoring it, Bennett. I'm questioning it. \nBennett: There's a difference between questioning and rejecting outright. \nJulian: And there's a difference between accepting and blindly following. \nBennett: I've seen the Earth with my own eyes, Julian. It's not a matter of faith, it's a matter of fact. \nJulian: And I've seen the lies with my own eyes, Bennett. It's not a matter of faith, it's a matter of fact. \nBennett: This is pointless. \nJulian: Because you're losing? \nBennett: No, because you're not listening. \nJulian: And you're not hearing. \nBennett: I can't do this. \nJulian: Running away, Bennett? \nBennett: No, Julian.
