You're killing yourself.\nMalcolm: Well, at least someone's trying to.\nOlivia: That's not funny!\nMalcolm: You're right, it's not. But it's easier than facing the truth.\nOlivia: And what truth is that, dad? That you're a drunk? That you've wasted your life? That you're a disappointment?\nMalcolm: That's a bit harsh, don't you think?\nOlivia: No, it's not. It's the truth. And it's about time someone said it.\nMalcolm: And you think you're the one to do it? My own daughter?\nOlivia: Who else, dad? Who else is left?\nMalcolm: I don't need this right now.\nOlivia: And when will you need it, dad? When you're on your deathbed? When it's too late?\nMalcolm: I said I don't need this!\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Malcolm would feel...\nThreatened\nResigned\nSpiteful\nDetached\n\nGive each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\n\nYou must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\n\nThreatened: <score>\nResigned: <score>\nSpiteful: <score>\nDetached: <score>\n\n\n[End of answer]\n\nRemember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\n\nYour answer:\n",
