The probability of high rainfall given waking up late can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of waking up late as \\(L\\), the event of high rainfall as \\(H\\), and the event of waking up on time as \\(T\\). We are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. \\(P(L) = 0.09\\)\n2. \\(P(H \\cap T) = 0.53\\)\n3. \\(P(H \\cap L) = 0.08\\)\n\nWe need to find \\(P(H \\mid L)\\).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[P(H \\mid L) = \\frac{P(L \\mid H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(L)}\\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\(P(L \\mid H)\\). We know that:\n\n\\[P(L \\mid H) = \\frac{P(L \\cap H)}{P(H)}\\]\n\nGiven \\(P(H \\cap L) = 0.08\\) and \\(P(H) = P(H \\cap T) + P(H \\cap L)\\), we can find \\(P(H)\\):\n\n\\[P(H) = 0.53 + 0.08 = 0.61\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[P(L \\mid H) = \\frac{0.08}{0.61}\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(P(H \\mid L)\\):\n\n\\[P(H \\mid L) =",
