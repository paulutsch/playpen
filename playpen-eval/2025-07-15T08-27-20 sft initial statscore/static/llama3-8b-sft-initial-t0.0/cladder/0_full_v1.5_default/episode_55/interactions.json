The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We know that:\n\n\\[P(L \\mid H) = \\frac{P(L \\cap H)}{P(H)}\\]\n\nGiven \\(P(H \\cap L) = 0.08\\) and \\(P(H) = P(H \\cap T) + P(H \\cap L)\\), we can find \\(P(H)\\):\n\n\\[P(H) = 0.53 + 0.08 = 0.61\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[P(L \\mid H) = \\frac{0.08}{0.61}\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(P(H \\mid L)\\):\n\n\\[P(H \\mid L) =",
