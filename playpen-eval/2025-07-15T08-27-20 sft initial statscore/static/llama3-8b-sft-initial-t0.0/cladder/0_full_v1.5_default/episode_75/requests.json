The probability of kwox given jyka can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of kwox given jyka as P(kwox|jyka). We are given that P(jyka) = 0.25, P(not jyka and kwox) = 0.71, and P(jyka and kwox) = 0.24.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(kwox). We know that P(not jyka and kwox) + P(jyka and kwox) = P(kwox). Therefore, P(kwox) = 0.71 + 0.24 = 0.95.\n\nNext, we need to find P(not jyka). We know that P(jyka) + P(not jyka) = 1. Therefore, P(not jyka) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nNow, we can calculate P(kwox|jyka) using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(kwox|jyka) = P(kwox and jyka) / P(jyka)\n= 0.24 / 0.25\n= 0.96\n\nP(kwox|not jyka) = P(kwox and not jyka) / P(not jyka)\n= P(k",
