Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The effect of eating citrus on scurvy is mediated by vitmain C. The probability of scurvy is 73% for patients not consuming citrus and 54% for patients consuming citrus. This indicates that eating citrus reduces the probability of scurvy, which is consistent with the effect of vitmain C on scurvy. Therefore, eating citrus positively affects scurvy through vitmain C.<|eot_id|>",
