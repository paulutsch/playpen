	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of large feet for CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters is 35%, which is lower than the probability of large feet for CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters (83%). This suggests that signing the termination letter may decrease the chance of large feet. However, the overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%, which is high. Therefore, the effect of manager signing the termination letter on the chance of large feet is likely to be small compared to the effect of CEO's decision to fire the employee.
