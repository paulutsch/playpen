The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 17%. The probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing alarm is 69%. The probability of alarm set by husband and ringing alarm is 3%. Is the chance of ringing alarm smaller when observing alarm set by husband?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of the alarm ringing when the husband sets it is 3%, and the probability of the alarm ringing when the husband does not set it is 69%. Since 3% is less than 69%, the chance of the alarm ringing is smaller when observing the alarm set by the husband.<|eot_id|>",
