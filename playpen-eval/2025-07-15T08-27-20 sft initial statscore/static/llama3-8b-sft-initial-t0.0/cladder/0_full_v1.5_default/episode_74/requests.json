Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%. Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lirg overall can be calculated as follows:\n- Probability of lirg given jyka = 0.66\n- Probability of lirg given not jyka = 0.71\n- Probability of jyka = 0.14\n- Probability of not jyka = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86\n- Overall probability of lirg = (0.66 * 0.14) + (0.71 * 0.86)\n= 0.0924 + 0.6136\n= 0.706\nSince 0.706 is greater than 0.5, lirg is more likely than not lirg overall.<|eot_id|>",
