The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of arriving to school on time can be calculated as follows:\n- Probability of waking up on time: 95% (1 - 5%)\n- Probability of arriving on time given waking up on time: 52%\n- Probability of arriving on time given waking up late: 87%\n- Probability of arriving on time = (95% * 52%) + (5% * 87%)\n= 0.95 * 0.52 + 0.05 * 0.87\n= 0.494 + 0.0435\n= 0.5375\nThe probability of arriving to school on time is 53.75%, which is greater than 50%. Therefore, arriving to school on time is more likely than arriving to school late overall.<|eot_id|>",
