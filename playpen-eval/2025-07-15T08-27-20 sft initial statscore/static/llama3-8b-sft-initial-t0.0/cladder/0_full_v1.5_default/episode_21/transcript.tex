	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of arriving to school on time can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt - Probability of waking up on time: 95% (1 - 5%)\\ \tt - Probability of arriving on time given waking up on time: 52%\\ \tt - Probability of arriving on time given waking up late: 87%\\ \tt - Probability of arriving on time = (95% * 52%) + (5% * 87%)\\ \tt = 0.95 * 0.52 + 0.05 * 0.87\\ \tt = 0.494 + 0.0435\\ \tt = 0.5375\\ \tt The probability of arriving to school on time is 53.75%, which is greater than 50%. Therefore, arriving to school on time is more likely than arriving to school late overall.
