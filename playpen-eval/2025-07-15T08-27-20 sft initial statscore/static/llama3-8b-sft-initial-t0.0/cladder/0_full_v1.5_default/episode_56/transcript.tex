	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 99%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 66%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 24%. Is black hair less likely than blond hair overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of black hair is 0.66 for people not using tanning salon treatments and 0.24 for people who went to tanning salons. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 0.99, so the overall probability of black hair is 0.99 * 0.24 + 0.01 * 0.66 = 0.2354. The overall probability of blond hair is 0.99 * 0.76 + 0.01 * 0.34 = 0.7646. Since 0.2354 < 0.7646, black hair is less likely than blond hair overall.
