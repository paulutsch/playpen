	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of employee being fired when the manager signs the termination letter is 74%, which is higher than the probability of employee being fired when the manager does not sign the termination letter (60%). This indicates that the manager signing the termination letter increases the chance of employee being fired.
