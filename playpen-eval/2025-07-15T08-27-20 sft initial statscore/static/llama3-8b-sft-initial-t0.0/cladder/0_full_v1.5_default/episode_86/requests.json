The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%. Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lirg given jyka is 12% / 14% = 0.8571, and the probability of lirg given not jyka is 72% / (100% - 14%) = 72% / 86% = 0.8372. Since 0.8571 > 0.8372, the chance of lirg is larger when observing jyka.<|eot_id|>",
