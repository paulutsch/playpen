Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%.

The probability of wet ground given rainy season can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of rainy season as R, the event of wet ground as G, and the event of dry season as D. We are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(R) = 0.87 (probability of rainy season)\n2. P(G|D) = 0.07 (probability of wet ground given dry season)\n3. P(G|R) = 0.5 (probability of wet ground given rainy season)\n\nWe want to find P(G|R). Using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(G|R) = P(R|G) \\* P(G) / P(R)\n\nSince we are given P(G|R) = 0.5, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P(R|G):\n\nP(R|G) = P(G|R) \\* P(R) / P(G)\n\nWe need to find P(G). We can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(G) = P(G|R) \\* P(R) + P(G|D) \\* P(D)\n\nSince P(D) = 1 - P(R) = 0.13 (probability of dry season), we have:\n\nP(G) = 0.5 \\* 0.87 + 0.07 \\* 0.13\n= 0.435 + 0.0091\n= 0.4441",
