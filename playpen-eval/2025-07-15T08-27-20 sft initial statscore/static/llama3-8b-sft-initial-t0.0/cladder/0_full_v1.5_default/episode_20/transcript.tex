	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of wet ground given rainy season can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of rainy season as R, the event of wet ground as G, and the event of dry season as D. We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. P(R) = 0.87 (probability of rainy season)\\ \tt 2. P(G|D) = 0.07 (probability of wet ground given dry season)\\ \tt 3. P(G|R) = 0.5 (probability of wet ground given rainy season)\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to find P(G|R). Using Bayes' theorem:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G|R) = P(R|G) \* P(G) / P(R)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since we are given P(G|R) = 0.5, we can rearrange the formula to solve for P(R|G):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(R|G) = P(G|R) \* P(R) / P(G)\\ \tt \\ \tt We need to find P(G). We can use the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G) = P(G|R) \* P(R) + P(G|D) \* P(D)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(D) = 1 - P(R) = 0.13 (probability of dry season), we have:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G) = 0.5 \* 0.87 + 0.07 \* 0.13\\ \tt = 0.435 + 0.0091\\ \tt = 0.4441
