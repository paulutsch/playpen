	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on zupj and muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. The overall probability of yupt is 1%. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%. Is muvq more likely than not muvq overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of muvq overall can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt - The probability of muvq for those who are not yupt is 33%, and the probability of not being yupt is 99% (since the probability of yupt is 1%). Therefore, the probability of muvq for those who are not yupt is 0.33 * 0.99 = 0.3267.\\ \tt - The probability of muvq for those who are yupt is 59%, and the probability of being yupt is 1%. Therefore, the probability of muvq for those who are yupt is 0.59 * 0.01 = 0.0059.\\ \tt - The overall probability of muvq is the sum of the probabilities of muvq for those who are not yupt and those who are yupt: 0.3267 + 0.0059 = 0.3326.\\ \tt Since 0.3326 is greater than 0.5, muvq is more likely than not muvq overall.
