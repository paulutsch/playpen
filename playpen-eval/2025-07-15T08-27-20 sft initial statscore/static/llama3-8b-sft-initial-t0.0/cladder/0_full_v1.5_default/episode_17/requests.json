The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of ringing alarm is 0.08 * 0.16 + 0.92 * 0.75 = 0.08 * 0.16 + 0.92 * 0.75 = 0.0128 + 0.69 = 0.7028. The probability of silent alarm is 0.08 * 0.84 + 0.92 * 0.25 = 0.0672 + 0.23 = 0.2978. Therefore, the probability of ringing alarm is greater than the probability of silent alarm.<|eot_id|>",
