Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%. Is wet ground more likely than dry ground overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of wet ground overall can be calculated by considering the probabilities of wet ground in the presence and absence of a full moon. The probability of a full moon is 16%, and the probability of wet ground given a full moon is 54%. The probability of no full moon is 84%, and the probability of wet ground given no full moon is 56%. The overall probability of wet ground is thus:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{wet ground}) = P(\\text{full moon}) \\times P(\\text{wet ground} | \\text{full moon}) + P(\\text{no full moon}) \\times P(\\text{wet ground} | \\text{no full moon}) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{wet ground}) = 0.16 \\times 0.54 + 0.84 \\times 0.56 \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{wet ground}) = 0.0864 + 0.4704 \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{wet ground}) = 0.5568 \\]\n\nSince \\( P(\\text{wet ground}) > 0.5 \\), wet ground is more likely than dry ground overall.<|eot_id|>",
