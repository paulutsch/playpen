	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%. Is wet ground more likely than dry ground overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of wet ground overall can be calculated by considering the probabilities of wet ground in the presence and absence of a full moon. The probability of a full moon is 16%, and the probability of wet ground given a full moon is 54%. The probability of no full moon is 84%, and the probability of wet ground given no full moon is 56%. The overall probability of wet ground is thus:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(\text{wet ground}) = P(\text{full moon}) \times P(\text{wet ground} | \text{full moon}) + P(\text{no full moon}) \times P(\text{wet ground} | \text{no full moon}) \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(\text{wet ground}) = 0.16 \times 0.54 + 0.84 \times 0.56 \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(\text{wet ground}) = 0.0864 + 0.4704 \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(\text{wet ground}) = 0.5568 \]\\ \tt \\ \tt Since \( P(\text{wet ground}) > 0.5 \), wet ground is more likely than dry ground overall.
