The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of admission acceptance is 0.61 for individuals who are not male and 0.65 for individuals who are male. The overall probability of male gender is 0.13, so the overall probability of admission acceptance is 0.13 * 0.65 + 0.87 * 0.61 = 0.623. The overall probability of admission rejection is 1 - 0.623 = 0.377. Since 0.623 > 0.377, admission acceptance is more likely than admission rejection overall.<|eot_id|>",
