To determine if rukz is more likely than not rukz overall, we need to calculate the overall probability of rukz. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The probability of pexu is 41%.\n2. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%.\n3. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%.\n\nLet's denote the probability of rukz as P(rukz). We can calculate P(rukz) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(rukz) = P(rukz | not pexu) \\* P(not pexu) + P(rukz | pexu) \\* P(pexu)\n\nWe know that P(pexu) = 0.41. We need to find P(not pexu).\n\nP(not pexu) = 1 - P(pexu) = 1 - 0.41 = 0.59\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n\nP(rukz) = 0.66 \\* 0.59 + 0.22 \\* 0.41\n= 0.3884 + 0.0902\n= 0.4786\n\nSince 0.4786 is greater than 0.5, we can conclude that rukz is more likely than not rukz overall.<|eot_id|>",
