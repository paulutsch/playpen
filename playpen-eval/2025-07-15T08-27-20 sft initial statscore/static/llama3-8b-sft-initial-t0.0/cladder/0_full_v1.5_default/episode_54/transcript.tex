	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of speaking english is 93%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 79%. For people who speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 65%. Is the forest on fire more likely than the forest not on fire overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of the forest on fire is 0.79 for people who do not speak english and 0.65 for people who speak english. The overall probability of speaking english is 0.93. Therefore, the overall probability of the forest on fire is 0.93 * 0.65 + 0.07 * 0.79 = 0.65 + 0.0553 = 0.7053. The probability of the forest not on fire is 1 - 0.7053 = 0.2947. Since 0.7053 > 0.2947, the forest on fire is more likely than the forest not on fire overall.
