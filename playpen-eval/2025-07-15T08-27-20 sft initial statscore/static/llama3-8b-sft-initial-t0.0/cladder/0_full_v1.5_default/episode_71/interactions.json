The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%. Will yomx increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
