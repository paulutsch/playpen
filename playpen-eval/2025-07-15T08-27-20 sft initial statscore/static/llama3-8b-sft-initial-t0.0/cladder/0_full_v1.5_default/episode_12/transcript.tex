	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. Method 1: We look at how eating citrus correlates with scurvy case by case according to vitmain C. Method 2: We look directly at how eating citrus correlates with scurvy in general. To understand how eating citrus affects scurvy, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The Method 1 is more correct than Method 2. The reason is that Method 1 takes into account the intermediate effect of vitmain C, which is the direct effect of eating citrus. This method can accurately capture the causal relationship between eating citrus and scurvy. In contrast, Method 2 only looks at the direct correlation between eating citrus and scurvy, which may not fully capture the causal relationship due to the presence of the intermediate effect of vitmain C.
