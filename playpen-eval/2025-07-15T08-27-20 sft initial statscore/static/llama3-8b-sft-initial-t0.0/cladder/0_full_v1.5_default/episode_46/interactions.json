The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and lip thickness. Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. The overall probability of receives treatment is 48%. For patients not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 64%. For patients receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 29%. Is thick lips more likely than thin lips overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
