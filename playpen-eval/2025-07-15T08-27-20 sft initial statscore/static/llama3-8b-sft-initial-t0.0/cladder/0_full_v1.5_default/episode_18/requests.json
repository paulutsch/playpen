The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of employee being fired is calculated as follows:\n- Probability of manager signing the termination letter: 35%\n- Probability of employee being fired given manager signs the termination letter: 42%\n- Probability of employee being fired given manager does not sign the termination letter: 76%\n- Probability of manager not signing the termination letter: 65% (1 - 35%)\n- Probability of employee being fired: 0.35 * 0.42 + 0.65 * 0.76 = 0.147 + 0.494 = 0.641\n- Probability of employee not being fired: 1 - 0.641 = 0.359\nSince 0.641 > 0.359, employee being fired is more likely than employee not being fired overall.<|eot_id|>",
