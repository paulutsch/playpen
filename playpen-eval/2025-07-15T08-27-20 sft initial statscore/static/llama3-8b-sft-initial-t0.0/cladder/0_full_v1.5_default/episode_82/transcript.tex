	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kwox has a direct effect on kwoz. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. The overall probability of kwox is 1%. For those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. For those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Is kwoz less likely than not kwoz overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of kwoz overall can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt - The probability of kwox is 1%, so the probability of not kwox is 99%.\\ \tt - The probability of kwoz given not kwox is 47%, so the probability of kwoz and not kwox is 0.99 * 0.47 = 0.4663.\\ \tt - The probability of kwox is 1%, so the probability of kwoz given kwox is 92%, so the probability of kwoz and kwox is 0.01 * 0.92 = 0.0092.\\ \tt - The overall probability of kwoz is the sum of the probabilities of kwoz and kwox, which is 0.4663 + 0.0092 = 0.4755.\\ \tt Since 0.4755 is greater than 0.5, kwoz is more likely than not kwoz overall.
