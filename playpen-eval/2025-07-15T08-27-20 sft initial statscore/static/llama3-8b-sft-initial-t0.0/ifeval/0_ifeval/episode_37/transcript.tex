	 title: assessing the long-term economic impact of the liberian civil war: a comparative analysis of pre-war and post-war economic indicators\\ \tt \\ \tt abstract:\\ \tt \\ \tt the liberian civil war, which lasted from 1989 to 2003, had a devastating impact on the country's economy. the war led to the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of millions of people, and a significant decline in economic output. this research project aims to assess the long-term economic impact of the war on liberia, using a comparative analysis of pre-war and post-war economic indicators. the study will examine the effects of the war on liberia's gdp, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and foreign investment, as well as the impact on the country's human development index (hdi). the research will also explore the role of international aid and the liberian government's economic policies in shaping the country's economic recovery.\\ \tt \\ \tt objectives:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. to analyze the economic indicators of liberia before and after the civil war, including gdp, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and foreign investment.\\ \tt 2. to assess the impact of the war on liberia's human development index (hdi).\\ \tt 3. to examine the role of international aid in liberia's economic recovery.\\ \tt 4. to evaluate the effectiveness of liberia's economic policies in addressing the challenges posed by the war.\\ \tt \\ \tt methodology:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. data collection: the study will collect data on liberia's economic indicators from 1980 to 2020, using sources such as the world bank, the international monetary fund (imf), and the liberian government's economic reports.\\ \tt 2. data analysis: the study will use statistical software to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns in liberia's economic indicators.\\ \tt 3. comparative analysis: the study will compare liberia's economic indicators before and after the civil war, using a comparative analysis framework.\\ \tt 4. case studies: the study will conduct case studies of liberia's economic sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services, to examine the impact of the war on these sectors.\\ \tt \\ \tt expected outcomes:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. a comprehensive understanding of the long-term economic impact of the liberian civil war.\\ \tt 2. a comparative analysis of liberia's economic indicators before and after the war.\\ \tt 3. an assessment of the role of international aid in liberia's economic recovery.\\ \tt 4. an evaluation of the effectiveness of liberia's economic policies in addressing the challenges posed by the war.\\ \tt \\ \tt expected contributions:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. the study will contribute to the existing literature on the economic impact of civil wars, providing a comprehensive analysis of the long-term effects of the liberian civil war.\\ \tt 2. the study will inform policy makers and international organizations on the importance of addressing the economic challenges posed by civil wars.\\ \tt 3. the study will provide insights into the role of international aid in economic recovery and the effectiveness of economic policies in addressing the challenges posed by civil wars.\\ \tt \\ \tt expected timeline:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. data collection: 3 months\\ \tt 2. data analysis: 6 months\\ \tt 3. comparative analysis: 3 months\\ \tt 4. case studies: 3 months\\ \tt 5.
