	 "Dear friend,\\ \tt \\ \tt I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. There are a few things that really trigger me and I thought it would be helpful to share them with you so we can be more mindful of them in our conversations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Firstly, I get really frustrated when people interrupt me while I'm speaking. It feels like they're not respecting my thoughts or opinions, and it can be really disorienting. If you notice me getting cut off, please try to let me finish my sentence before you respond.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another thing that really gets under my skin is when people make assumptions about me or my life without asking questions or listening to my perspective. It feels like they're not taking the time to understand me, and it can be really hurtful. If you're unsure about something, please don't be afraid to ask me questions or clarify things with me.\\ \tt \\ \tt Lastly, I get really upset when people use sarcasm or passive-aggressive language. It feels like they're not being genuine or respectful, and it can be really draining. If you're feeling frustrated or upset, please try to express yourself in a more direct and respectful way.\\ \tt \\ \tt I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and I appreciate your willingness to listen and be more mindful of these triggers. Let's work together to create a more supportive and respectful environment for each other.\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]"\\ \tt \\ \tt "End of email"
