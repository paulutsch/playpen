My wife, Sarah, walked into the room. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" she asked. I shook my head. \"Nothing,\" I said. She sat down beside me. \"You've been acting strange all day,\" she said. I shrugged. \"I don't know,\" I said. She put her hand on my arm. \"Maybe you should talk to someone,\" she said. I looked at her. \"Who?\" I asked. She shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"Maybe a therapist?\" I shook my head. \"I don't think that's necessary,\" I said. She nodded. \"Okay,\" she said. \"But if you need to talk, I'm here.\" I nodded. \"Thanks,\" I said. She leaned over and kissed me. \"I love you,\" she said. I smiled. \"I love you too,\" I said.<|eot_id|>",
