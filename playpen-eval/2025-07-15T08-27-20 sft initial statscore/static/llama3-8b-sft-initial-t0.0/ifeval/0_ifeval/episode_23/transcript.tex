	 I sat on the couch, staring at the wall. My wife, Sarah, walked into the room. "Hey, what's wrong?" she asked. I shook my head. "Nothing," I said. She sat down beside me. "You've been acting strange all day," she said. I shrugged. "I don't know," I said. She put her hand on my arm. "Maybe you should talk to someone," she said. I looked at her. "Who?" I asked. She shrugged. "I don't know," she said. "Maybe a therapist?" I shook my head. "I don't think that's necessary," I said. She nodded. "Okay," she said. "But if you need to talk, I'm here." I nodded. "Thanks," I said. She leaned over and kissed me. "I love you," she said. I smiled. "I love you too," I said.
