realms, I find my peace,\nA world of wonder, where worries cease.\nThe controller's grip, a soothing hold,\nAs I escape reality, young and old.\n\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy social life, a distant, fading trend.\nFriends and family, left to their own,\nAs I indulge in digital thrills, alone.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy physical health, begins to say goodbye.\nThe couch potato, a sedentary fate,\nA life of inactivity, an unhealthy state.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy eyes grow tired, my vision, a blur, a trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy mental health, begins to ask why.\nThe isolation, a lonely, empty space,\nA life of disconnection, a lonely, empty place.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy mind grows weary, my thoughts, a jumbled trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy relationships, begin to say goodbye.\nThe friends and family, left to their own,\nAs I indulge in digital thrills, alone.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy heart grows heavy, my love, a distant trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy future, begins to ask, \"Why?\"\nThe opportunities, lost, the chances, few,\nA life of regret, a life, not lived anew.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy heart grows heavy, my love, a distant trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy life, begins to ask, \"Why?\"\nThe choices, made, the paths, not taken,\nA life of what-ifs, a life, not lived, unspoken.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy heart grows heavy, my love, a distant trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a delicate balance,\nA double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\nThe joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\nA world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\n\nBut as the hours mount, and the days go by,\nMy soul, begins to ask, \"Why?\"\nThe purpose, lost, the meaning, few,\nA life of emptiness, a life, not lived, anew.\n\nThe screen's glow, a constant companion,\nA source of comfort, a soothing balm.\nBut as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\nMy heart grows heavy, my love, a distant trend.\n\nThe pros and cons, a
