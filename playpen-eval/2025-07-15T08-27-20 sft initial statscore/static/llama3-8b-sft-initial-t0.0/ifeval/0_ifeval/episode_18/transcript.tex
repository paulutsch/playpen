	 **The Double-Edged Sword of Gaming**\\ \tt \\ \tt In virtual realms, I find my peace,\\ \tt A world of wonder, where worries cease.\\ \tt The controller's grip, a soothing hold,\\ \tt As I escape reality, young and old.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\\ \tt My social life, a distant, fading trend.\\ \tt Friends and family, left to their own,\\ \tt As I indulge in digital thrills, alone.\\ \tt \\ \tt The pros and cons, a delicate balance,\\ \tt A double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\\ \tt The joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\\ \tt A world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours mount, and the days go by,\\ \tt My physical health, begins to say goodbye.\\ \tt The couch potato, a sedentary fate,\\ \tt A life of inactivity, an unhealthy state.\\ \tt \\ \tt The screen's glow, a constant companion,\\ \tt A source of comfort, a soothing balm.\\ \tt But as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\\ \tt My eyes grow tired, my vision, a blur, a trend.\\ \tt \\ \tt The pros and cons, a delicate balance,\\ \tt A double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\\ \tt The joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\\ \tt A world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours mount, and the days go by,\\ \tt My mental health, begins to ask why.\\ \tt The isolation, a lonely, empty space,\\ \tt A life of disconnection, a lonely, empty place.\\ \tt \\ \tt The screen's glow, a constant companion,\\ \tt A source of comfort, a soothing balm.\\ \tt But as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\\ \tt My mind grows weary, my thoughts, a jumbled trend.\\ \tt \\ \tt The pros and cons, a delicate balance,\\ \tt A double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\\ \tt The joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\\ \tt A world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours mount, and the days go by,\\ \tt My relationships, begin to say goodbye.\\ \tt The friends and family, left to their own,\\ \tt As I indulge in digital thrills, alone.\\ \tt \\ \tt The screen's glow, a constant companion,\\ \tt A source of comfort, a soothing balm.\\ \tt But as the hours tick by, and the days blend,\\ \tt My heart grows heavy, my love, a distant trend.\\ \tt \\ \tt The pros and cons, a delicate balance,\\ \tt A double-edged sword, that cuts both ways, in dance.\\ \tt The joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\\ \tt A world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours mount, and the days go by,\\ \tt My future, begins to ask, "Why?"\\ \tt The opportunities, lost, the chances, few,\\ \tt A life of regret, a life, not lived anew.\\ \tt \\ \tt The screen's glow, a constant companion,\\ \tt A source of comfort, a soothing balm.\\ \tt But as

dance.\\ \tt The joy of gaming, a release, a thrill,\\ \tt A world of adventure, where my heart can fill.\\ \tt \\ \tt But as the hours mount, and the days go by,\\ \tt My life, begins to ask, "Why?"\\ \tt The choices, made, the paths, not taken,\\ \tt A life of what-ifs, a life, not lived, unspoken.\\ \tt \\ \tt The screen's glow, a constant companion,\\ \tt A source of comfort, a soothing
