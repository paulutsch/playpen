I'm a master of the art of doing nothing, and I'm pretty sure that's what you're looking for in a candidate.\n\nAs a seasoned professional with years of experience in doing absolutely nothing, I'm confident that I can bring a new level of excitement to your team. My skills include:\n\n* The ability to stare at a wall for hours on end without blinking\n* Expert-level procrastination techniques\n* A proven track record of getting nothing done on time\n\nI'm available to start immediately, as long as you're willing to provide me with a comfortable couch and a steady supply of snacks. I'm also happy to work remotely, as long as you're willing to provide me with a reliable internet connection and a good Wi-Fi signal.\n\nIn short, I'm the perfect candidate for the job. I'm not too qualified, I'm not too experienced, and I'm definitely not too motivated. But hey, that's what makes me so lovable, right?\n\nSincerely,\nDarius\"",
