	 Here is an example of a journal entry about stress management:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Today, I felt overwhelmed by my workload. I realized that I was trying to do too many things at once, which was causing me to feel anxious and stressed. I decided to prioritize my tasks and focus on one thing at a time. I also took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that I can handle whatever comes my way. By taking control of my tasks and managing my time, I was able to reduce my stress levels and feel more focused and productive."\\ \tt \\ \tt I came up with this example by thinking about common stressors that people may experience, such as feeling overwhelmed by work or responsibilities. I then thought about how someone might manage their stress, such as by prioritizing tasks, taking deep breaths, and focusing on one thing at a time. I tried to make the example relatable and realistic, and I used simple language to make it easy to understand.
