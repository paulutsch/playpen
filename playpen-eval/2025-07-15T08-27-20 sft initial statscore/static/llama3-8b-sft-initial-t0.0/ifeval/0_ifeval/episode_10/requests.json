Task Summary\n**Task Title:** Implementing a Secure Data Storage System\n**Task Description:** Design and implement a secure data storage system for a web application, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The system should utilize encryption, access control, and backup mechanisms to protect user data.\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\n**Motivation:** The current data storage system is vulnerable to data breaches and lacks robust security measures. Implementing a secure data storage system is crucial to protect user data and maintain the trust of our users.\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n**Milestone 1: System Design (Week 1-2)**\n- Define system architecture and components.\n- Identify security requirements and design measures to address them.\n- Develop a detailed system design document.\n\n**Milestone 2: Implementation (Week 3-6)**\n- Implement encryption and decryption mechanisms.\n- Integrate access control and authentication systems.\n- Develop backup and recovery procedures.\n\n**Milestone 3: Testing and Deployment (Week 7-10)**\n- Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessment.\n- Deploy the system in a production environment.\n- Monitor system performance and security.\n\n***\nPart 4.
