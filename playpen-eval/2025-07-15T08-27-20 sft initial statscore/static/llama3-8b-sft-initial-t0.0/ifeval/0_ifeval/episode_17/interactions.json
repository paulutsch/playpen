The remaining members have at least 1 pet, and at most 2 pets. Let's denote the number of members with 1 pet as \\(y\\) and the number of members with 2 pets as \\(z\\). We have the following constraints:\n\n1. The total number of members is 20, so \\(x + y + z = 20\\).\n2. The total number of pets is 32, so \\(3x + y + 2z = 32\\).\n\nWe want to maximize \\(x\\), the number of members with 3 pets. To do this, we need to minimize \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Since each member has at least one pet, \\(y \\geq 0\\) and \\(z \\geq 0\\).\n\nLet's solve the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y + z &= 20 \\\\\n3x + y + 2z &= 32\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n\\[\n2x + z = 12\n\\]\n\nSince \\(z \\geq 0\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n2x \\leq 12 \\Rightarrow x \\leq 6\n\\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\(x = 6\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n6 + y + z = 20 \\Rightarrow y + z = 14\n\\]\n\nSince \\(y \\geq 0\\) and \\(z \\geq 0\\), we have:\n\n\\[\ny + z = 14 \\Rightarrow y = 14 - z\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 14 - z\\) into the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n3(6) + (14 - z) + 2z = 32 \\Rightarrow 18 + 14 - z + 2z = 32 \\Rightarrow z = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have \\(z = 0\\), so \\(y = 14\\). Substituting \\(z = 0\\) into the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n6 + y + 0 = 20 \\Rightarrow y = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, we have \\(x = 6\\), \\(y = 14\\), and \\(z = 0\\).\n\nThe maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is \\(x = \\boxed{6}\\).\"",
