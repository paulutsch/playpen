  "input": "Question:\nDistinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes.\nOptions:\nA. Structural proteins provide temporary cellular functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure to cells\nB. Structural proteins control cell activity while functional proteins are part of the cell protoplasm\nC. Structural proteins catalyze chemical reactions while functional proteins are involved in the structure of the cell\nD. Structural proteins are soluble in the cell while functional proteins are generally insoluble\nE. Structural proteins are found only outside the cell, while functional proteins are exclusively found inside the cell\nF. Structural proteins are only used for muscle contraction, while functional proteins are responsible for energy production\nG. Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.\nH. Structural proteins are unable to catalyze any reactions, while functional proteins form the structural components of ribosomes\nI. Structural proteins are synthesized from amino acids in the cytoplasm, while functional proteins are synthesized in the nucleus\nJ. Structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, while functional proteins are produced by membrane-bound ribosomes\n",
