Studies have established the following facts: 1. A line of 5 mauve caterpillars is as long as a line of 7 violet caterpillars. 2. A line of 3 lavender caterpillars and 1 mauve caterpillar is as long as a line of 8 violet caterpillars. 3. A line of 5 lavender caterpillars, 5 mauve caterpillars and 2 violet caterpillars is 1 m long in total. 4.  A lavender caterpillar takes 10 s to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar. 5.
