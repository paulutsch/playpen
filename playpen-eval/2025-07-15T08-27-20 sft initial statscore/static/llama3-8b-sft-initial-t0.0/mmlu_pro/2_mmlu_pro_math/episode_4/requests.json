A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\nOptions:\nA. 3 + e^-2\nB. 2 - e^-4\nC. 2 - e^-2\nD. 3 + e^-4\nE. 2 + e^-3\nF. 2 - e^-3\nG. 3 - e^-2\nH. 2 + e^-2\nI. 2 + e^-4\nJ. 2\nThe answer is (I)\n\nQuestion:\nA total of 30 players will play basketball at a park.
