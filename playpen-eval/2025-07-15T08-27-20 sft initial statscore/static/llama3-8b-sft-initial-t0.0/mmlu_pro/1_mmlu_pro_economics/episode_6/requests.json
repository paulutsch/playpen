Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nFor a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will\nOptions:\nA. Never occur\nB. Persist indefinitely\nC. Cause a permanent change in the trend\nD. Grow exponentially\nE. Only affect the next period\nF. Eventually die away\nG. Cause the process to become non-stationary\nH. Immediately disappear\nI. Lead to a cyclical pattern\nJ. Be balanced out by subsequent shocks\nThe answer is (F)\n\nQuestion:\nConsider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by\nOptions:\nA. 0.45\nB. 0.2\nC. 0.4\nD. 0.1\nE. 0.3\nF. 0.55\nG. 0.25\nH. 0.33\nI. 0.6\nJ. 0.5\nThe answer is (H)\n\nQuestion:\nSuppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\nOptions:\nA.

Higher taxes on household income\nB. Increased government spending\nC. Increased taxes on corporate profits\nD. Increased import tariffs\nE. Decreased interest rates\nF. Lower taxes on consumer goods\nG. Lower taxes on research and development of new technology\nH. Reduced government spending\nI. Higher taxes on capital gains\nJ.

N/A\nThe answer is (F)\n\nQuestion:\nExplain how the reduced personal risk of corporate organi-zation allows for greater efficiency.\nOptions:\nA. Personal risk is reduced because corporate efficiency is directly tied to government subsidies.\nB. Investors are less likely to undertake great risk if their personal liability is limited.\nC. Corporate organization allows for risk to be shared among many individuals, leading to inefficiency due to too many decision-makers.\nD. The risk in corporate organization limits efficiency.\nE. Corporate structures eliminate all financial risks for investors, promoting reckless investment strategies.\nF. The reduced personal risk is a byproduct of corporate taxation, which is the real driver of efficiency.\nG. Efficient production means small-scale production.\nH. Investors face increased personal risk in corporate organizations, which deters investment and reduces efficiency.\nI. Limited liability feature of corporate organization induces investors to undertake the large risks necessary for large-scale production and efficiency.\nJ. Reduced personal risk comes from the ability to transfer shares easily, which has no impact on efficiency.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
