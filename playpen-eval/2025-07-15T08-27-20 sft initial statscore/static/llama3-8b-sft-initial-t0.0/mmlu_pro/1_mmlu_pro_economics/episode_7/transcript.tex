Be balanced out by subsequent shocks\\ \tt The answer is (F)\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\\ \tt yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\\ \tt The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. 0.45\\ \tt B. 0.2\\ \tt C. 0.4\\ \tt D. 0.1\\ \tt E. 0.3\\ \tt F. 0.55\\ \tt G. 0.25\\ \tt H. 0.33\\ \tt I. 0.6\\ \tt J. 0.5\\ \tt The answer is (H)\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\\ \tt (i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\\ \tt (ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\\ \tt (iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\\ \tt (iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. (iii) and (iv) only\\ \tt B. (i) and (iv) only\\ \tt C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\\ \tt D. (i) and (ii) only\\ \tt E. (i) and (iii) only\\ \tt F. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\\ \tt G.
