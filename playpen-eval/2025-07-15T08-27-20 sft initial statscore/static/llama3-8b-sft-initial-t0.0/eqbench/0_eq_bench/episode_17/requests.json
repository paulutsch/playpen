I've heard tales of your cold-blooded poker face.\nEsther: And you must be Benny the Bluff. I've heard you're quite the charmer. \nBen: Guilty as charged, sweetheart. But don't let that fool you. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.\nEsther: I'm sure you do. But remember, Ben, this isn't a magic show. It's a game of skill. \nBen: And a little bit of luck, wouldn't you agree?\nEsther: Luck is for those who can't rely on their abilities.\nBen: Spoken like a true Ice Queen. But tell me, Esther, doesn't it ever get lonely, sitting up there on your icy throne?\nEsther: Better alone at the top than surrounded by fools at the bottom.\nBen: Ouch! That's a sharp tongue you've got there. \nEsther: It's served me well so far.\nBen: I can see that. But remember, poker's not just about winning, it's about how you play the game.\nEsther: And yet, it seems I'm the one raking in the chips.\nBen: For now, sweetheart, for now.
