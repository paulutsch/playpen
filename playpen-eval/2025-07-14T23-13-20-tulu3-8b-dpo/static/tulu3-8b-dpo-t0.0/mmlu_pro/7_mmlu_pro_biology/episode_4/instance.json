Design an experiment to support the existence of another process that results in variation.\nOptions:\nA. Artificial genetic modification through genetic engineering techniques\nB. Spontaneous mutation\nC. Recombination of traits through conjugation\nD. Exposure to mutagenic chemicals that induce DNA changes\nE. Genetic drift\nF. Binary fission\n",
