The frequency of each allele is the number of that allele divided by the total number of alleles.\n\nFrequency of L^m:\nL^m frequency = (Number of L^m alleles) / (Total number of alleles) = 1064 / 1600 = 0.66\n\nFrequency of L^n:\nL^n frequency = (Number of L^n alleles) / (Total number of alleles) = 408 / 1600 = 0.255\n\nSince the alleles are codominant, the sum of their frequencies should be 1:\n0.66 + 0.255 = 0.915, which",
