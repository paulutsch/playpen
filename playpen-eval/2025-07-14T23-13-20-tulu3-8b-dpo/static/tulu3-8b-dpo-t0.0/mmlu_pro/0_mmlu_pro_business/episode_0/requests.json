His tax rates are as follows: $.41 per $100 for a local college fund $.02 per $100 for special education $.001 per $100 for health and welfare $.089 per $100 for community construction How much tax does Mr. Howard pay for each of these needs? What was the total tax?\nOptions:\nA. $3.23\nB. $21.43\nC. $18.88\nD. $20.00\nE. $17.65\nF. $22.50\nG. $19.76\nH. $16.34\nI. $15.47\nJ. $14.88\n\n<|assistant|>\nThe answer is (G)\n\nExplanation: \nFirst, calculate the assessed value of the house:\nAssessed Value = House Value * Assessment Rate\nAssessed Value = $16,500 * 22% = $3,630\n\nNext, calculate the tax for each need:\n\nLocal College Fund: \nTax = Assessed Value * Local College Fund Rate / 100\nTax = $3,630 * $0.41 / 100 = $14.89 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSpecial Education:\nTax = Assessed Value * Special Education Rate / 100\nTax = $3,630 * $0.02 / 100 = $0.73\n\nHealth and Welfare:\nTax = Assessed Value * Health and Welfare Rate / 100\nTax = $3,630 * $0.001 / 100 = $0.0363 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nCommunity Construction:\nTax = Assessed Value * Community Construction Rate / 100\nTax = $3,630 * $0.089 / 100 = $3.23\n\nNow, sum up all the taxes to find the total tax:\nTotal Tax = Local College Fund + Special Education + Health and Welfare + Community Construction\nTotal Tax = $14.89 + $0.73 + $0.0363 + $3.23 = $18.9023 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the total tax Mr. Howard pays is $",
