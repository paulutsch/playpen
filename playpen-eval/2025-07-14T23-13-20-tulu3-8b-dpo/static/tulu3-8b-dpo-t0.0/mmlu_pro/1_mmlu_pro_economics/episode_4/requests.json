Which one of the following statements is true?\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\nOptions:\nA.

Marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed.\nB. Utility is the quantity of a product. Marginal utility is the increase in quantity which a consumer gets from an additional unit of a specific good.\nC. Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.\nD. Utility is the duration of time a product can be used. Marginal utility is the increase in usage time with each additional unit consumed.\nE. Utility is the measure of scarcity of a good. Marginal utility is the change in scarcity when one more unit of the good is produced.\nF. Utility is the weight of a product. Marginal utility is the additional weight a consumer perceives when purchasing an extra unit of a specific good.\nG. Utility is the power to make a good. Marginal utility is the extra power which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.\nH. Utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed, holding the level of consumption constant.\nI. Utility is the price of a good. Marginal utility is the increase in price which a consumer pays for an additional unit of a specific good.\nJ. Utility is the demand for a product. Marginal utility is the change in demand as the supply of a specific good increases.\n\n<|assistant|>\n",
