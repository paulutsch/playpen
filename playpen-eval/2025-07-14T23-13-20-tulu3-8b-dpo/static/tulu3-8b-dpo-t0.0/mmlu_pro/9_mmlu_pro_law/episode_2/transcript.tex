Tradition.\\ \tt The answer is (G)\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. The second amendment - the right to bear arms.\\ \tt B. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\ \tt C. The tenth amendment - powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.\\ \tt D. The first amendment - freedom of speech.\\ \tt E. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\\ \tt F. The commerce clause.\\ \tt G. The sixth amendment - right to a fair trial.\\ \tt H. The eighth amendment - prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.\\ \tt I. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\ \tt J. N/A\\ \tt The answer is (F)\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt Each year the state provides a number of non- interest-bearing loans andlor scholarships to candidates for the degree of L. L. B or J. D. at the state's law school. The applicable state statute limits eligibility to citizens of the United States and aliens seeking U. S. citizenship. A candidate for a J. D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U. S. citizenship, he was refused the loan for ineligibility under the state statute. In a suit by the candidate challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, he will\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. lose, because the state has the right to limit eligibility for its programs.\\ \tt B. lose, because the statute promotes a compelling state interest.\\ \tt C. lose, because the statute is in accordance with the state's education policies.\\ \tt D. lose, because alienage classifications are not, per Se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\\ \tt E. win, because the statute infringes on the candidate's right to financial aid.\\ \tt F. win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.\\ \tt G. lose, because classifications by a state based on citizenship status are constitutional.\\ \tt H. win, because the statute is violative of the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\ \tt I. win, because the statute discriminates against those who choose not to pursue U.S. citizenship.\\ \tt J. win, because the statute violates the candidate's right to equal treatment under the law.\\ \tt
