Task Summary\nThe task involves optimizing the performance of the company's web application by refactoring the database queries and implementing caching mechanisms. The goal is to reduce query execution time and improve the overall user experience by minimizing latency.\n\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\nThe current state of the web application suffers from slow response times, particularly during peak usage hours. This is largely due to inefficient database queries and a lack of caching strategies. By optimizing these aspects, we aim to enhance user satisfaction, reduce server load, and improve the scalability of the application. This will also align with our goal of providing a seamless and responsive user experience, which is crucial for retaining and growing our user base.\n\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n- **Milestone 1:** Identify and refactor the top 5 most resource-intensive database queries.\n- **Milestone 2:** Implement a basic caching system for frequently accessed data.\n- **Milestone 3:** Test the performance improvements and gather metrics.\n- **Milestone 4:** Deploy the optimized code to the staging environment for further testing.\n- **Milestone 5:** Review and iterate on the caching strategy based on performance metrics.\n\n***\nPart 4. Timeline\n- **Week 1:** Research and identify the top 5 resource-intensive queries (Day 1-5).\n- **Week 2:** Refactor the identified queries and implement basic caching (Day 6-10).\n- **Week 3:** Test performance improvements and gather metrics (Day 11-15).\n- **Week 4:** Deploy to staging environment and conduct further testing (Day 16-20).\n- **Week 5:** Review and iterate on caching strategy (Day 21-25).\n\n***\nPart 5. Doc history\n- **Version 1.0:** Initial draft created (Date: 2023-10-01)\n- **Version 1.1:** Adjusted timeline and added more detail to milestones (Date: 2023-10-05)\n- **Version 1.2:** Updated to reflect changes in caching strategy (Date: 2023-10-10)\n- **Version 1.3:** Finalized before deployment to staging (Date: 2023-10-20)<|end_of_text|>",
