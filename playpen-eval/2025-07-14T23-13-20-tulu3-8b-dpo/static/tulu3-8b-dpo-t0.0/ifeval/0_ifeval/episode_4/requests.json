Your response must contain a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>. Use less than 5 sentences.\n<|assistant|>\n<<Impact of Heavier Axles on Road Infrastructure>>\n\nWhen vehicles with increased axle weights travel on roads, they exert greater pressure on the pavement. This increased pressure accelerates the deterioration of the road surface, leading to more frequent repairs and maintenance. The additional stress can cause cracks, potholes, and other structural damages, which reduce the lifespan of the road. As a result, roads designed for standard axle loads may become unsafe and require upgrades to handle the heavier traffic. This situation can lead to higher costs for road authorities and taxpayers.<|end_of_text|>",
