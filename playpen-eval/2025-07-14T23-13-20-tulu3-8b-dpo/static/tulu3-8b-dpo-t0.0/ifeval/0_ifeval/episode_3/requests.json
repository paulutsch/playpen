Use all lowercase letters and include the word story at least twice.\n<|assistant|>\nhello fellow students of islamic history! today, i want to share a story about the hajj pilgrimage, a journey that holds profound significance for muslims around the world. the story of hajj begins with the prophet muhammad, who received the revelation to perform this pilgrimage. every year, thousands of people from diverse backgrounds come together, each carrying their own story of faith and hope. as they circle the kaaba and run between safa and marwa, they become part of a larger story, one that unites them in worship and brotherhood. the hajj is not just a journey but a story of submission, reflection, and renewal. let's continue to explore and share these inspiring stories together! #hajjstory #islamicjourney<|end_of_text|>",
