	 Rewrite the following text so that it is funny to software engineers using notations from the book "The C Programming Language": "The use of the various constructions described in this chapter is one of the most distinctive features of the C programming language." Make this sound like it is being said by the president of the United States and capitalize every letter.

	 FELLOW SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, AS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE C LANGUAGE, I AM HERE TO DECLARE THAT THE EMPLOYMENT OF VARIOUS CONSTRUCTS, AS OUTLINED IN THIS CHAPTER, IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF OUR GREAT C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. JUST AS AMERICA STANDS FOR FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, C STANDS FOR COMPACT AND CONTROLLED CODE CONSTRUCTIONS. FROM THE SIMPLEST IF STATEMENTS TO THE MOST COMPLEX SWITCH CASES, THESE ARE THE BRICKS AND MORTAR OF OUR DIGITAL ESTATES. SO LET US ALL RAISE A TOAST TO THE POWERFUL "&&" AND "||" OPERATORS, THE "FOR" LOOPS THAT NEVER END, AND THE "GOTO" STATEMENTS THAT SOME SAY SHOULD BE BANNISHED BUT WE KNOW ARE JUST MISUNDERSTOOD. LONG LIVE THE C LANGUAGE, THE TRUE SYMBOL OF OUR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING HERITAGE. GOD BLESS AMERICA, AND MAY OUR CODE ALWAYS RUN SMOOTHLY.<|end_of_text|>
