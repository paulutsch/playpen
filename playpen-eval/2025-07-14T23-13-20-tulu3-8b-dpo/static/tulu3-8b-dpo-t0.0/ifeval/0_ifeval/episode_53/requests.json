Your answer must contain one of the following exact phrases: ”My answer is yes.\", \"My answer is no.\", \"My answer is maybe.\"\n<|assistant|>\nGiven the equation a + b = 10 and the condition that a > b, we need to determine if a must be 6.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. **a + b = 10**: This equation tells us that the sum of a and b is 10.\n2. **a > b**: This condition tells us that a is greater than b.\n\nIf a = 6, then b = 10 - 6 = 4. In this case, a > b is satisfied because 6 > 4.\n\nSince a = 6 satisfies both conditions (a + b = 10 and a > b), we can conclude that a could be 6 without violating the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, my answer is maybe.<|end_of_text|>",
