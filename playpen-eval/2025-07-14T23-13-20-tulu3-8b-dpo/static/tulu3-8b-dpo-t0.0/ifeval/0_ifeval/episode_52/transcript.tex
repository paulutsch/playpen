	 I've noticed someone following me for a while now. It started a few days ago when I felt a chill down my spine as I turned a corner and saw a shadowy figure. I tried to ignore it at first thinking it was just my imagination. But today it happened again. I was walking home from school and I could feel someone watching me. I quickened my pace but they kept pace with me. I turned down a different street but they were there too. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I need to tell my mom.<|end_of_text|>
