Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.\n<|assistant|>\n\"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many family members can have 3 pets while ensuring the total number of pets remains 32 and each of the 20 family members has at least one pet.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of members who have 3 pets.\n- \\( y \\) as the number of members who have 2 pets.\n- \\( z \\) as the number of members who have 1 pet.\n\nGiven:\n1. The total number of family members is 20: \n   \\[\n   x + y + z = 20\n   \\]\n2. The total number of pets is 32:\n   \\[\n   3x + 2y + 1z = 32\n   \\]\n\nWe aim to maximize \\( x \\), the number of members with 3 pets.\n\n**Step 1: Express \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from the first equation:**\n   \\[\n   z = 20 - x - y\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( z \\) into the second equation:**\n   \\[\n   3x + 2y + (20 - x - y) = 32\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   3x + 2y + 20 - x - y = 32\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x + y + 20 = 32\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x + y = 12\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Maximize \\( x \\) under the constraint \\( 2x + y = 12 \\).**\n\nTo maximize \\( x \\), we minimize \\( y \\) because \\( y \\) represents members with fewer pets.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( y \\) when \\( x \\) is maximized:**\n\n- If \\( x = 4 \\) (the maximum possible value since each member must have at least one pet):\n  \\[\n  2(4) + y = 12\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  8 + y = 12\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 4\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate \\( z \\):**\n  \\[\n  z = 20 - x - y = 20 - 4 - 4 = 12\n  \\]\n\n**Verification:**\n- Pets calculation: \\( 3 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 12 = 12 + 8 + 12 = 32 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nThus, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 4. \n\nThe final answer is: '4'.\"<|end_of_text|>",
