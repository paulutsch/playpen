	 The Jimenez family has 20 members. Each member has at least one pet. If there are 32 pets in total, what is the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets? Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.

	 "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many family members can have 3 pets while ensuring the total number of pets remains 32 and each of the 20 family members has at least one pet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote:\\ \tt - \( x \) as the number of members who have 3 pets.\\ \tt - \( y \) as the number of members who have 2 pets.\\ \tt - \( z \) as the number of members who have 1 pet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given:\\ \tt 1. The total number of family members is 20: \\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    x + y + z = 20\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt 2. The total number of pets is 32:\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    3x + 2y + 1z = 32\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt \\ \tt We aim to maximize \( x \), the number of members with 3 pets.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step 1: Express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \) from the first equation:**\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    z = 20 - x - y\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step 2: Substitute \( z \) into the second equation:**\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    3x + 2y + (20 - x - y) = 32\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt    Simplify:\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    3x + 2y + 20 - x - y = 32\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    2x + y + 20 = 32\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    2x + y = 12\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step 3: Maximize \( x \) under the constraint \( 2x + y = 12 \).**\\ \tt \\ \tt To maximize \( x \), we minimize \( y \) because \( y \) represents members with fewer pets.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step 4: Solve for \( y \) when \( x \) is maximized:**\\ \tt \\ \tt - If \( x = 4 \) (the maximum possible value since each member must have at least one pet):\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   2(4) + y = 12\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   8 + y = 12\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   y = 4\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step 5: Calculate \( z \):**\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   z = 20 - x - y = 20 - 4 - 4 = 12\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt \\ \tt **Verification:**\\ \tt - Pets calculation: \( 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 12 = 12 + 8 + 12 = 32 \), which matches the given total.\\ \tt \\ \tt Thus, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 4. \\ \tt \\ \tt The final answer is: '4'."<|end_of_text|>
