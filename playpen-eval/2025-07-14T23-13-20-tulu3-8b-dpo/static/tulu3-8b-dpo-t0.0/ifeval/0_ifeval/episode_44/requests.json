In the afternoon, a \"Silly Science Demo\" promises explosive fun, featuring experiments that defy the laws of physics and common sense. The day ends with a \"Dance-Off in the Quad,\" where moves are as unpredictable as the weather.\n\n***  \n\nDay 3: The Farewell Frenzy  \nThe final day is a whirlwind of excitement and laughter. A \"Comedy Workshop\" led by the renowned Jester Jokesalot will teach students how to crack jokes that even the statues chuckle at. Following this, they will participate in the \"Great Escape Room Challenge,\" a race against time to solve puzzles and unlock secrets, all while dodging fake security guards. As the sun sets, a \"Bonfire Bash\" will light up the night, featuring storytelling sessions where legends are born and friendships are solidified. The evening concludes with a \"Goodbye Gala,\" where everyone shares their favorite moments and promises to never forget the \"Greatest Three Days Ever.\"\n\n***  \n\nIn conclusion, this hilariously crafted itinerary ensures that every moment is filled with joy, laughter, and unforgettable memories.
