However, the choice of words can be nuanced. The German word \"clever\" is often used to convey intelligence or quick-wittedness, which is similar to the English \"smart.\" While \"schlau\" is indeed a synonym for clever, it might carry a slightly different connotation, possibly implying more cunning or crafty, which might not be the exact nuance intended in the original sentence. The word \"intelligent\" could also be used to translate \"smart\" in a more general sense, focusing on academic or intellectual abilities. Thus, while \"clever\" is a good choice here, it's worth noting that the translation could subtly alter the original meaning.<|end_of_text|>",
