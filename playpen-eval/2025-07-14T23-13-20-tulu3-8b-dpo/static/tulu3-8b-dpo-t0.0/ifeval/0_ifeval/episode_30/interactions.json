Second, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to data-driven decision-making, resisting any undue pressure from those who may seek to exaggerate the inflation threat. In this context, it is essential that we approach our economic analysis with the same meticulous care as one would when writing their memoirs, ensuring that every detail is considered with the gravitas it deserves, much like the careful application of ink to paper.<|end_of_text|>",
