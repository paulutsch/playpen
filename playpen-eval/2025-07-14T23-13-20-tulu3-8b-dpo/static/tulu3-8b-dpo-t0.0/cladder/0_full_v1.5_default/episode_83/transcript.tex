	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tijv has a direct effect on tijw and xevo. Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. For those who are not tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 29%. For those who are not tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 14%. For those who are tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 11%. For those who are tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 16%. The overall probability of tijv is 88%. Will xevo increase the chance of gyzp?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, xevo does not increase the chance of gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether xevo increases the chance of gyzp, we need to compare the probabilities of gyzp across different groups and consider the direct effects and the overall probabilities.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's summarize the given probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Probability of gyzp for those who are not tijv and are not xevo: 29%\\ \tt - Probability of gyzp for those who are not tijv and are xevo: 14%\\ \tt - Probability of gyzp for those who are tijv and are not xevo: 11%\\ \tt - Probability of gyzp for those who are tijv and are xevo: 16%\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, we calculate the overall probability of gyzp without considering xevo:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Probability of not being tijv: 1 - 0.88 = 0.12\\ \tt - Probability of being tijv: 0.88\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the law of total probability, the overall probability of gyzp (P(gyzp)) can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(gyzp) = P(gyzp | \text{not tijv and not xevo}) \cdot P(\text{not tijv and not xevo}) + P(gyzp | \text{not tijv and xevo}) \cdot P(\text{not tijv and xevo}) + P(gyzp |
