The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%. Will yomx increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We will use the law of total probability to assess this.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the overall probability of xevu:\n\n- Probability of xevu for those not gwet and not yomx: \\( P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) = 0.82 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those not gwet and yomx: \\( P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land Yomx) = 0.63 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those gwet and not yomx: \\( P(Xevu | Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) = 0.36 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those gwet and yomx: \\( P(Xevu | Gwet \\land Yomx) = 0.18 \\)\n\nThe overall probability of xevu can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \nP(Xevu) = P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) \\cdot P(\\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) + \n          P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land",
