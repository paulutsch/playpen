We will use the law of total probability to assess this.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the overall probability of xevu:\n\n- Probability of xevu for those not gwet and not yomx: \\( P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) = 0.82 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those not gwet and yomx: \\( P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land Yomx) = 0.63 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those gwet and not yomx: \\( P(Xevu | Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) = 0.36 \\)\n- Probability of xevu for those gwet and yomx: \\( P(Xevu | Gwet \\land Yomx) = 0.18 \\)\n\nThe overall probability of xevu can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \nP(Xevu) = P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) \\cdot P(\\neg Gwet \\land \\neg Yomx) + \n          P(Xevu | \\neg Gwet \\land",
