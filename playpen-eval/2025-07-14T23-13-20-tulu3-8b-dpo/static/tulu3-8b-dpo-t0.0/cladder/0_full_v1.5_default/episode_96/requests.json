Since Qwiu is unobserved, we cannot directly infer its state, but we know it has a causal effect on Jyka.\n\n2. **Jyka causes Yupt**: This establishes a direct causal link from Jyka to Yupt.\n\n3. **Qwiu or Yupt causes Kwox**: This introduces a situation where either Qwiu or Yupt (or both) can cause Kwox. Since Qwiu is unobserved, we cannot determine its direct effect on Kwox, but we know that Jyka's effect on Yupt could potentially influence Kwox through Yupt.\n\nGiven these relationships, if an individual is not Jyka, it does not necessarily mean they are not Kwox. Here's why:\n\n- **Direct Effect of Qwiu on Kwox**: Even if Jyka is not present, Kwox could still be caused directly by Qwiu, given that Qwiu has a direct effect on Kwox. Since Qwiu is unobserved, we cannot rule out its influence.\n\n- **Indirect Effect through Yupt**: If J",
