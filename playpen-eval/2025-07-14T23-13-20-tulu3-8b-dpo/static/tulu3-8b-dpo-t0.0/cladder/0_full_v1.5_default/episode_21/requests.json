We can do this by considering the probabilities given:\n\n1. **Probability of waking up on time:** 95% (since the probability of waking up late is 5%).\n\n2. **Probability of arriving on time given waking up on time:** 52%.\n\n3. **Probability of arriving on time given waking up late:** 87%.\n\nThe overall probability of arriving on time can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = P(\\text{On Time} \\mid \\text{On Time}) \\cdot P(\\text{On Time}) + P(\\text{On Time} \\mid \\text{Late}) \\cdot P(\\text{Late}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = (0.52 \\cdot 0.95) + (0.87 \\cdot 0.05) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = (0.494) + (0.0435) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = 0.5375 \\]\n\nThe overall probability of arriving on time is 53.75%. \n\nThe probability of arriving late is the complement of arriving on time:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Late}) = ",
