Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%.

Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, lung cancer is not more likely than the absence of lung cancer overall. \n\nTo understand this, we need to consider the probabilities and the relationships between the variables:\n\n1. **Gender and Smoking**: Gender has a direct effect on smoking, but since gender is unobserved, we cannot use it to make predictions.\n\n2. **Smoking and Lung Cancer**: The probability of lung cancer for smokers is 61%, and for nonsmokers, it is 58%. This indicates that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, but the increase is relatively small (3%).\n\n3. **Tar Deposit and Lung Cancer**: Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer, but since we are not given the specific probabilities related to tar deposits, we cannot incorporate this into our direct calculation.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- Probability of being a smoker = 12% = 0.12\n- Probability of lung cancer given smoking (P(Lung Cancer | Smoking)) = 61% = 0.61\n- Probability of lung cancer given not smoking (P(Lung Cancer | Not Smoking)) = 58% = 0.58\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of lung cancer (P(Lung Cancer)) using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(Lung Cancer) = P(Lung Cancer | Smoking) \\cdot P(Smoking) + P(Lung Cancer | Not Smoking) \\cdot P(Not Smoking) \\]\n\nWhere \\( P(Not Smoking) = ",
