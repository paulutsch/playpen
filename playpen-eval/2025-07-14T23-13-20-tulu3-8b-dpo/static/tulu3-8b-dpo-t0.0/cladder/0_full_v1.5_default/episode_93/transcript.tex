	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is tijw. Would an individual is not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, an individual is not necessarily not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo.\\ \tt \\ \tt The reason is that, given the structure of the causal relationships in this hypothetical world, there are multiple pathways through which gyzp can be influenced:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effect of Xevo on Gyzp**: Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. If xevo is present, it can directly cause gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Indirect Effect through Tijv**: Xevo can affect gyzp indirectly through tijv. Since xevo causes tijv, and tijv has a direct effect on gyzp, if xevo is present, it can cause gyzp through this pathway.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Effect of Tijw on Gyzp**: Tijw also has a direct effect on gyzp. Since we know the individual is tijw, this pathway is active regardless of whether xevo is present or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given these pathways, even if xevo is not present, the presence of tijw ensures that gyzp can still be caused directly by tijw. Therefore, the absence of xevo does not guarantee the absence of gyzp, because tijw can independently cause gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt To summarize, the causal pathways from xevo to gyzp are not the only means by which gyzp can be realized. The presence of tijw provides an alternative pathway
