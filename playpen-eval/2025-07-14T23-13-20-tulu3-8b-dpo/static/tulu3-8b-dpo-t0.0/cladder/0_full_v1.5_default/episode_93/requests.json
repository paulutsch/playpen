Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp.

If xevo is present, it can directly cause gyzp.\n\n2. **Indirect Effect through Tijv**: Xevo can affect gyzp indirectly through tijv. Since xevo causes tijv, and tijv has a direct effect on gyzp, if xevo is present, it can cause gyzp through this pathway.\n\n3. **Effect of Tijw on Gyzp**: Tijw also has a direct effect on gyzp. Since we know the individual is tijw, this pathway is active regardless of whether xevo is present or not.\n\nGiven these pathways, even if xevo is not present, the presence of tijw ensures that gyzp can still be caused directly by tijw. Therefore, the absence of xevo does not guarantee the absence of gyzp, because tijw can independently cause gyzp.\n\nTo summarize, the causal pathways from xevo to gyzp are not the only means by which gyzp can be realized. The presence of tijw provides an alternative pathway",
