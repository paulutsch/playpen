Would the child is intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nYes, the child is likely to be intelligent if the parents are intelligent instead of unintelligent, given the conditions specified.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Direct Effect of Parents' Intelligence on Child's Intelligence**: According to the problem statement, parents' intelligence has a direct effect on the child's intelligence. Intelligent parents are more likely to pass on their intelligence genes or provide an environment that fosters intellectual development, thus increasing the likelihood of the child being intelligent.\n\n2. **Direct Effect of Parents' Social Status on Child's Intelligence**: Parents' social status also has a direct effect on the child's intelligence. However, this effect is not the primary driver of the child's intelligence in this scenario, as the problem specifies that parents' intelligence directly affects the child's intelligence.\n\n3. **Role of Confounder**: The confounder (actively present and observed) is assumed to affect both parents' social status and child's intelligence. However, the problem states that intelligent parents and the confounder together cause high parental social status. This implies that the confounder's effect is mediated through the parents' intelligence rather than independently affecting the child's intelligence.\n\n4. **Intelligent Parents vs. Unintelligent Parents**: Given that intelligent parents directly cause an intelligent child, and considering the confounder's role as described, the presence of intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents is the primary causal factor influencing the child's intelligence. The confounder, while active, does not negate the direct effect of parents'",
