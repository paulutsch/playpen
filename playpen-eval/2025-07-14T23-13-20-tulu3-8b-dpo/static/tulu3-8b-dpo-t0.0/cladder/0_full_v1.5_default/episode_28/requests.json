For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nYes, it would be less likely to see college admission for smokers compared to nonsmokers under the given conditions. This is because we have two direct causal relationships established in this hypothetical world:\n\n1. **Smoking affects effort**: Smoking has a direct negative effect on effort. This means that, on average, smokers are likely to exert less effort compared to nonsmokers, given the same circumstances.\n\n2. **Effort affects college admission**: Effort has a direct positive effect on college admission. Higher effort is associated with a higher probability of college admission.\n\nGiven these relationships, we can infer the following:\n\n- **Nonsmokers**: The probability of college admission is 67%, which presumably accounts for the average level of effort nonsmokers put into their studies.\n\n- **Smokers**: The probability of college admission is 55%, which is lower than nonsmokers. This lower probability can be attributed to the negative effect of smoking on effort. Smokers, on average, exert less effort due to their smoking habit, and this reduced effort leads to a lower probability of college admission.\n\nTo answer the question directly: If we hypothetically change a smoker to a nonsmoker, assuming all else remains equal (including the effort level that nonsmokers typically exert), the probability of college admission would increase from 55% to 67%. This is because the negative effect of smoking on effort would be removed, allowing the student to exert the effort level typical of nonsmokers, which",
