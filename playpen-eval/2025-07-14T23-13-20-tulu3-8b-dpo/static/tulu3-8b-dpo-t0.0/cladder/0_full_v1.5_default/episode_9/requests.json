Appearance has a direct effect on relationship status. The overall probability of kindness is 85%. For people with mean personalities and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 38%. For people with mean personalities and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 71%. For people with kind personalities and single people, the probability of attractive appearance is 32%. For people with kind personalities and in a relationship, the probability of attractive appearance is 57%. If we look at people in a relationship, does the chance of attractive appearance decrease when kindness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

For instance, it's possible that people with kind personalities are more likely to be in relationships with less emphasis on physical appearance, or that the definition",
