We can do this by considering the probability of muvq given the different states of yupt and applying the law of total probability.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(Yupt) = 0.01 \\) (probability of being Yupt)\n- \\( P(Muvq|Yupt) = 0.59 \\) (probability of Muvq given Yupt)\n- \\( P(Muvq|\\neg Yupt) = 0.33 \\) (probability of Muvq given not Yupt)\n\nThe probability of not being Yupt is \\( P(\\neg Yupt) = 1 - P(Yupt) = 0.99 \\).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall probability of muvq (denoted as \\( P(Muvq) \\)) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ P(Muvq) = P(Muvq|Yupt) \\cdot P(Yupt) + P(Muvq|\\neg Yupt) \\cdot P(\\neg Yupt) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(Muvq) = (0.59 \\times 0.01) + (0.33 \\times 0.99) \\]\n\\[ P(Muvq) =",
