	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on zupj and muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. The overall probability of yupt is 1%. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%. Is muvq more likely than not muvq overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, muvq is not more likely than not muvq overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether muvq is more likely than not muvq overall, we need to calculate the overall probability of muvq occurring. We can do this by considering the probability of muvq given the different states of yupt and applying the law of total probability.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote:\\ \tt - \( P(Yupt) = 0.01 \) (probability of being Yupt)\\ \tt - \( P(Muvq|Yupt) = 0.59 \) (probability of Muvq given Yupt)\\ \tt - \( P(Muvq|\neg Yupt) = 0.33 \) (probability of Muvq given not Yupt)\\ \tt \\ \tt The probability of not being Yupt is \( P(\neg Yupt) = 1 - P(Yupt) = 0.99 \).\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the law of total probability, the overall probability of muvq (denoted as \( P(Muvq) \)) is calculated as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Muvq) = P(Muvq|Yupt) \cdot P(Yupt) + P(Muvq|\neg Yupt) \cdot P(\neg Yupt) \]\\ \tt \\ \tt Substituting the given probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Muvq) = (0.59 \times 0.01) + (0.33 \times 0.99) \]\\ \tt \[ P(Muvq) =
