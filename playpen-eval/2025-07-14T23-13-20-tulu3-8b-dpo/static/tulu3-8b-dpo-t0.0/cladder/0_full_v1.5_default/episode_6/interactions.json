The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's define the following events:\n\n- A: Attractive appearance (P(A) = 0.56)\n- U: Unattractive appearance (P(U) = 1 - P(A) = 0.44)\n- T: Talent\n- L: Lack of talent\n\nGiven:\n- P(T|U) = 0.09 (Probability of talent given unattractive appearance)\n- P(T|A) = 0.09 (Probability of talent given attractive appearance)\n\nWe want to determine if talent (T) is more likely than lack of talent (L) overall, i.e., P(T) > P(L).\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of talent for the entire population:\n\nP(T) = P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|U) * P(U)\n\nP(T) = (0.09 * 0.56) + (0.09 * 0.44)\nP(T) = 0.0504 + 0.0396\nP(T) = 0.0900\n\nNext, calculate the probability of lack of talent:\n\nP(L) = 1 - P(T)\nP(L) = 1 - 0.0900\nP(L) = 0.9100\n\nSince P(T) = 0",
