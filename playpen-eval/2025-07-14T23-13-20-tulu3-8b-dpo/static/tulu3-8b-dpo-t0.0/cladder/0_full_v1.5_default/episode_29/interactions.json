The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This change in probability suggests a causal relationship between consuming citrus and the risk of scurvy. \n\nThe mechanism for this causal effect is vitamin C. Citrus fruits are a rich source of vitamin C, and vitamin C is known to prevent scurvy by ensuring that the body can synthesize collagen, which is essential for wound healing and maintaining healthy connective tissue. \n\nGiven that there are no other factors mentioned that could influence the development of scurvy, and considering the direct effect of vitamin C on scurvy, we can infer that the observed decrease in the probability of scurvy in patients consuming citrus is due to the intake of vitamin C. Therefore, eating citrus positively affects scurvy through its content of vitamin C.<|end_of_text|>",
