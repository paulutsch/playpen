	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of black hair is not smaller when observing a college degree or higher.\\ \tt \\ \tt To solve this problem, we need to calculate the conditional probability of black hair given a college degree or higher (P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher)) and compare it to the unconditional probability of black hair (P(Black Hair)).\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's define the probabilities given in the problem:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(College Degree or Higher) = 0.06\\ \tt - P(Black Hair | High School Degree or Lower) = 0.25\\ \tt - P(College Degree or Higher and Black Hair) = 0.03\\ \tt \\ \tt We need to calculate P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) using Bayes' Theorem:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) = [P(College Degree or Higher and Black Hair)] / P(College Degree or Higher)\\ \tt \\ \tt Substitute the given values:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) = (0.03) / (0.06) = 0.5\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's calculate the unconditional probability of black hair (P(Black Hair)):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Black Hair) = P(Black Hair | High School Degree or Lower) * P(High School Degree or Lower) + P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) * P(College Degree or Higher)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(High School Degree or Lower) = 1 - P(College Degree or
