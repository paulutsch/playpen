Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of black hair is not smaller when observing a college degree or higher.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the conditional probability of black hair given a college degree or higher (P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher)) and compare it to the unconditional probability of black hair (P(Black Hair)).\n\nFirst, let's define the probabilities given in the problem:\n\n- P(College Degree or Higher) = 0.06\n- P(Black Hair | High School Degree or Lower) = 0.25\n- P(College Degree or Higher and Black Hair) = 0.03\n\nWe need to calculate P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) using Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) = [P(College Degree or Higher and Black Hair)] / P(College Degree or Higher)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nP(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) = (0.03) / (0.06) = 0.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the unconditional probability of black hair (P(Black Hair)):\n\nP(Black Hair) = P(Black Hair | High School Degree or Lower) * P(High School Degree or Lower) + P(Black Hair | College Degree or Higher) * P(College Degree or Higher)\n\nSince P(High School Degree or Lower) = 1 - P(College Degree or",
