The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 1%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Therefore, we cannot directly infer anything about zuph based on Zory.\n   - **Zuph → Glimx:** Zuph has a direct effect on glimx.\n   - **Jyka → Glimx:** Jyka has a direct effect on glimx.\n\n2. **Given Probabilities:**\n   - Probability of Zuph (P(Zuph)) = 8% = 0.08\n   - Probability of Not Zuph and Glimx (P(Not Zuph ∧ Glimx)) = 58% = 0.58\n   - Probability of Zuph and Glimx (P(Zuph ∧ Glimx)) = 1% = 0.01\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The probability of Zuph and Glimx (P(Zuph ∧ Glimx)) is given as 1%, which is 0.01.\n   - The probability of Not Zuph and Glimx (P(Not Zuph ∧ Glimx)) is given as",
