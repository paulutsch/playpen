Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%.

Therefore, we cannot directly infer anything about zuph based on Zory.\n   - **Zuph → Glimx:** Zuph has a direct effect on glimx.\n   - **Jyka → Glimx:** Jyka has a direct effect on glimx.\n\n2. **Given Probabilities:**\n   - Probability of Zuph (P(Zuph)) = 8% = 0.08\n   - Probability of Not Zuph and Glimx (P(Not Zuph ∧ Glimx)) = 58% = 0.58\n   - Probability of Zuph and Glimx (P(Zuph ∧ Glimx)) = 1% = 0.01\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The probability of Zuph and Glimx (P(Zuph ∧ Glimx)) is given as 1%, which is 0.01.\n   - The probability of Not Zuph and Glimx (P(Not Zuph ∧ Glimx)) is given as",
