The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 15%. For those who are not zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 50%. For those who are zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 32%. For those who are zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 85%. The overall probability of zuph is 84%. Will rixq increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Xevu | Not Zuph, Not Rixq) = 0.15\n- P(Xevu | Not Zuph, Rixq) = 0.50\n- P(Xevu | Zuph, Not Rixq) = 0.32\n- P(Xevu | Zuph, Rixq) = 0.85\n- P(Zuph) = 0.84\n\nWe want to determine if being rixq increases the probability of xevu. To do this, we calculate the overall probability of xevu considering the presence of both zuph and rixq.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of xevu for those who are not zuph:\n\nP(Xevu | Not Zuph) = P(Xevu | Not Zuph, Not Rixq) * P(Not Rixq | Not Zuph) + P(Xevu | Not Zuph, Rixq) * P(Rixq | Not Zuph)\n\nSince P(Not Zuph) = 1 - P(Zuph) = 0.16 (from 1 -",
