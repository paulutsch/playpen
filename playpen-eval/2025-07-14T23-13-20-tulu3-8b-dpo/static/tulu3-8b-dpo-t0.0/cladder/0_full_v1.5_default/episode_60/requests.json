Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of having large feet is not smaller when observing a college degree or higher. \n\nTo understand why, let's break down the given causal relationships and probabilities:\n\n1. **Direct Effects:**\n   - Unobserved confounders affect both education level and foot size.\n   - Proximity to a college affects education level.\n   - Education level affects foot size.\n\n2. **Probabilities:**\n   - Probability of having a college degree or higher (P(C)) = 47%.\n   - Probability of having a high school degree or lower and large feet (P(HS ∧ L)) = 32%.\n   - Probability of having a college degree or higher and large feet (P(C ∧ L)) = 10%.\n\n3. **Calculation of P(L | C):**\n   To find the probability of having large feet given a college degree or higher (P(L | C)), we use Bayes' Theorem:\n\n   \\[\n   P(L | C) = \\frac{P(C ∧ L)}{P(C)}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given probabilities:\n\n   \\[\n   P(L | C) = \\frac{0.10}{0.47} \\approx 0.213\n   \\]\n\n   This means the probability of having large feet given a college degree or higher is approximately 21.3%.\n\n4. **Calculation of P(L):**\n   To find the overall probability of having large feet (P(L",
