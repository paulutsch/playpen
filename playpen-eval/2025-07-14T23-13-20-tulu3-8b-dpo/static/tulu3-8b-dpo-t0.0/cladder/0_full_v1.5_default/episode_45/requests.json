Treatment has a direct effect on lip thickness. For patients who have small kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 6%. For patients who have small kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 38%. For patients who have large kidney stones and not receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 63%. For patients who have large kidney stones and receiving treatment, the probability of thick lips is 95%. The overall probability of large kidney stone is 50%. For patients receiving treatment, would it be more likely to see thick lips if the patient had received no treatment?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

We have the following probabilities:\n\n- Small kidney stones, no treatment: Probability of thick lips = 6%\n- Small kidney stones, treatment: Probability of thick lips = 38%\n- Large kidney stones, no treatment: Probability of thick lips = 63%\n- Large kidney stones, treatment: Probability of thick lips = 95%\n\nThe overall probability of having a large kidney stone is 50%. \n\nWhen considering patients who receive treatment, we need to calculate the expected probability of thick lips, taking into account the probability of having small versus large kidney stones.\n\n**Expected Probability of Thick Lips for Treated Patients:**\n\n1. **Probability of having small kidney stones and receiving treatment:**\n   - Since the overall probability of having a large kidney stone is 50%, the probability of having a small kidney stone is 50%.\n   - Therefore, the probability of having small kidney stones and receiving treatment is 50% of 50% = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n2. **Probability of thick lips given small kidney stones and treatment:**\n   - This is given as 38%.\n\n3. **Probability of having large kidney stones and receiving treatment:**\n   - Similarly, the probability of having large kidney stones and receiving treatment",
