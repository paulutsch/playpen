Since the individual is not swoy, rixq must be the cause of zuph in this case.\n\n3. **Observation**:\n   - The individual is observed to not be swoy.\n\n4. **Effect of Rixq**:\n   - Given that rixq causes zuph, if rixq changes (from not rixq to rixq), zuph will change accordingly.\n\n5. **Indirect Effect on Xevu**:\n   - Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. If zuph changes due to a change in rixq (from not rixq to rixq), xevu might also change because zuph's effect on xevu is direct.\n\nHowever, the question does not provide enough information to determine the specific nature of these effects (i.e., whether the effect of zup",
