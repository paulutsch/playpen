The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To answer this, we need to compare **P(Wet Ground | Rainy Season)** to **P(Wet Ground)**, the unconditional probability of wet ground.\n\nFirst, let's calculate **P(Wet Ground)** using the law of total probability:\n\n**P(Wet Ground) = P(Wet Ground | Rainy Season) * P(Rainy Season) + P(Wet Ground | Dry Season) * P(Dry Season)**\n\nSince the probability of a dry season is **1 - P(Rainy Season) = 0.13**, we substitute:\n\n**P(Wet Ground) = (0.50 * 0.87) + (0.07 * 0.13)**\n\n**P(Wet Ground) = 0.435 + 0.0091 = 0.4441**",
