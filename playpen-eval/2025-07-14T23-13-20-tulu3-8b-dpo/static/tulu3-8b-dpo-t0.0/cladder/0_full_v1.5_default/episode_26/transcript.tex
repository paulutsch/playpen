	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities and the relationships between the variables as described:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Gender and Admission Status:**\\ \tt    - Probability of being male (P(Male)) = 13% = 0.13\\ \tt    - Probability of admission acceptance given male (P(Admit | Male)) = 65% = 0.65\\ \tt    - Probability of admission rejection given male (P(Reject | Male)) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35\\ \tt \\ \tt    For non-males (P(Non-Male) = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87):\\ \tt    - Probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit | Non-Male)) = 61% = 0.61\\ \tt    - Probability of admission rejection (P(Reject | Non-Male)) = 1 - 0.61 = 0.39\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Overall Probability of Admission Acceptance:**\\ \tt    We use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit)):\\ \tt \\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    P(Admit) = P(Admit | Male) \cdot P(Male) + P(Admit | Non-Male) \cdot P(Non-Male)\\ \tt    \]\\ \tt \\ \tt    Substituting the given values:\\ \tt \\ \tt    \[\\ \tt    P(Admit) = (0.65 \
