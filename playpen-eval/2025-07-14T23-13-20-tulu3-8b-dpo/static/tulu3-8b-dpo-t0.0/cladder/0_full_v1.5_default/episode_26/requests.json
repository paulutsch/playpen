Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities and the relationships between the variables as described:\n\n1. **Gender and Admission Status:**\n   - Probability of being male (P(Male)) = 13% = 0.13\n   - Probability of admission acceptance given male (P(Admit | Male)) = 65% = 0.65\n   - Probability of admission rejection given male (P(Reject | Male)) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35\n\n   For non-males (P(Non-Male) = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87):\n   - Probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit | Non-Male)) = 61% = 0.61\n   - Probability of admission rejection (P(Reject | Non-Male)) = 1 - 0.61 = 0.39\n\n2. **Overall Probability of Admission Acceptance:**\n   We use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit)):\n\n   \\[\n   P(Admit) = P(Admit | Male) \\cdot P(Male) + P(Admit | Non-Male) \\cdot P(Non-Male)\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n\n   \\[\n   P(Admit) = (0.65 \\",
