The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 31%. The probability of no full moon and wet ground is 33%. The probability of full moon and wet ground is 19%. Is the chance of wet ground smaller when observing full moon?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
