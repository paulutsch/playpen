	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Swoy has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. For those who are not rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 46%. For those who are not rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 41%. For those who are rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 66%. For those who are rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 60%. For those who are not rixq, the probability of zuph is 61%. For those who are rixq, the probability of zuph is 34%. For those who are rixq, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not rixq?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not rixq.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this, we need to consider the conditional probabilities provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **For those who are not rixq:**\\ \tt    - Probability of xevu given not rixq and not zuph = 46%\\ \tt    - Probability of xevu given not rixq and zuph = 41%\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **For those who are rixq:**\\ \tt    - Probability of xevu given rixq and not zuph = 66%\\ \tt    - Probability of xevu given rixq and zuph = 60%\\ \tt \\ \tt The question asks whether, for those who are rixq, it would be more likely to see xevu if they were not rixq. To answer this, we compare the probabilities of xevu for rixq individuals under the two scenarios (rixq and not rixq).\\ \tt \\ \tt - **If the individual is rixq:**\\ \tt   - The highest probability of xevu is 66% when the individual is rixq and not zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt - **If the individual is not rixq:**\\ \tt   - The highest probability of xevu is 46% when the individual is not rixq and not zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since 66% (the probability of xevu when rixq and not zuph) is greater
