To determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of lirg, taking into account both the probability of being jyka and the conditional probabilities given jyka status.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(J) \\) as the probability of being jyka, which is 0.14.\n- \\( P(L|J) \\) as the probability of lirg given jyka, which is 0.66.\n- \\( P(L|not J) \\) as the probability of lirg given not jyka, which is 0.71.\n\nThe overall probability of lirg, \\( P(L) \\), can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(L) = P(L|J) \\cdot P(J) + P(L|not J) \\cdot P(not J) \\]\n\nWhere \\( P(not J) = 1 - P(J) = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86 \\).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(L) = (0.66 \\cdot 0.14) + (0.71 \\cdot 0.86) \\]\n\\[ P(L) = 0.0924 + 0.6106 \\]\n\\[ P(L) = 0.703 \\]\n\nSince \\( P(L) = 0.703 \\), which is",
