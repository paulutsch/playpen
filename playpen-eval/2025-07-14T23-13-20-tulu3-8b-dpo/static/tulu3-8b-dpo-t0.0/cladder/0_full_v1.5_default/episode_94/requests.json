The fact that an individual is not Tijv does not provide information about whether Xevo is the cause of Gyzp in that individual. \n\nTo determine if an individual would be Gyzp if not Xevo, we would need additional information about the nature of the causal relationships between Xevo, Tijv, and Gyzp. Specifically, we would need to know:\n\n1. The relative strength of the causal effects of Xevo and Tijv on Gyzp. If Xevo has a stronger effect than Tijv, then the absence of Xevo might be more likely to result in the absence of Gyzp, even if Tijv is not present.\n\n2. The possibility of interaction effects between Xevo and Tijv on Gyzp. If the presence of both Xevo and Tijv is required to cause Gyzp, then the absence of Tijv does not imply that Gyzp would be absent if Xevo were also absent.\n\n3. The possibility of other confounding variables or unobserved factors that could affect Gyzp. Without controlling for these",
