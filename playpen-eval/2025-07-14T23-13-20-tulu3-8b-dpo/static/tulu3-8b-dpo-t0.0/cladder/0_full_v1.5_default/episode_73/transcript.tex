	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on gyzp and hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. Gyzp has a direct effect on lirg. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 63%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 49%. For those who are jyka, would it be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the principles of causal inference and the given direct effects:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - Jyka has a direct effect on gyzp and hwax.\\ \tt    - Hwax has a direct effect on lirg.\\ \tt    - Gyzp has a direct effect on lirg.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Conditional Probabilities**:\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg for those who are not jyka: 63%.\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg for those who are jyka: 49%.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given these conditions, we are asked whether the probability of lirg would be higher if an individual who is jyka were not jyka.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Reasoning**:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Direct Pathway**: The direct effect of gyzp on lirg suggests that being jyka (which affects gyzp) has a direct causal pathway to influencing lirg. However, the question also states that the probability of lirg is lower (49%) for those who are jyka compared to those who are not (63%).\\ \tt   \\ \tt - **Indirect Pathway**: The direct effect of hwax on lirg, and the fact that jyka affects hwax, implies that being jyka influences lirg indirectly through hwax.
