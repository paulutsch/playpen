However, the question also states that the probability of lirg is lower (49%) for those who are jyka compared to those who are not (63%).\n  \n- **Indirect Pathway**: The direct effect of hwax on lirg, and the fact that jyka affects hwax, implies that being jyka influences lirg indirectly through hwax.
