Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%.

Will waking up late increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, waking up late does not increase the chance of arriving to school on time. While it is true that the probability of arriving on time is higher when Alice wakes up late (78%) compared to when she wakes up on time (46%), this comparison alone does not establish a causal relationship. \n\nIn causal inference, we look for evidence that the change in the condition (waking up late) is the direct cause of the change in the outcome (arriving on time). Here, we have only observed associations between these variables, not a controlled experiment or any other method to establish causation.\n\nTo establish causation, we would need to rule out confounding variables, which could potentially explain the observed association. For instance, it's possible that on days when Alice wakes up late, she is more motivated or takes fewer detours, which could independently increase her chances of arriving on time. Without controlling for these potential confounders, we cannot conclude that waking up late itself causes Alice to arrive on time.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot assert a causal relationship where waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time. The observed difference in probabilities could be due to other factors not mentioned in the problem statement.<|end_of_text|>",
