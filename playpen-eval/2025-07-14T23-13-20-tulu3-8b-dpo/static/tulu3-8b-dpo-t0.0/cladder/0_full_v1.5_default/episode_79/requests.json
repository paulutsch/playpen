Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz. The overall probability of pexu is 41%. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%.

To determine the overall probability of rukz, we need to consider the probability of rukz for both those who are pexu and those who are not pexu, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of pexu (P(Pexu)) = 0.41\n- Probability of rukz given not pexu (P(Rukz|~Pexu)) = 0.66\n- Probability of rukz given pexu (P(Rukz|Pexu)) = 0.22\n\nThe overall probability of rukz (P(Rukz)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(Rukz) = P(Rukz|Pexu) \\cdot P(Pexu) + P(Rukz|~Pexu) \\cdot P(~Pexu) \\]\n\nWhere \\( P(~Pexu) = 1 - P(Pexu) = 1 - 0.41 = 0.59 \\).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(Rukz) = (0.22 \\cdot 0.41) + (0.66 \\cdot 0.59) \\]\n\\[ P(Rukz) = (0.0902) + (0.3884) \\]\n\\[ P(Rukz) = 0.4786 \\]\n\n",
