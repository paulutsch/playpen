	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. We know that zory causes zuph. zuph causes not jyka. zory or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is zory. Would an individual is not glimx if not zuph instead of zuph?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, an individual would not necessarily be not glimx if not zuph instead of zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's the reasoning:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effect of Zory on Glimx**: Zory has a direct effect on glimx. This means that Zory can influence Glimx directly, regardless of Zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Zuph's Effect on Jyka**: Zuph has a direct effect on Jyka. However, we are told that Zuph causes not Jyka, which implies that the presence of Zuph is associated with Jyka being absent or having a negative effect on Jyka.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Jyka's Effect on Glimx**: Jyka has a direct effect on Glimx. This means that Jyka can influence Glimx directly.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Zory or Jyka Causes Glimx**: We know that either Zory or Jyka can cause Glimx. Given that Zory has a direct effect on Glimx, if Zory is observed, it could directly cause Glimx, regardless of the state of Zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. **Given Condition**: We are given that an individual is Zory. This means that Zory is present and could directly affect Glimx.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given these conditions, even if Zuph were not present (i.e., not zuph instead of zuph), Zory
