We observed an individual is zory.

This means that Zory can influence Glimx directly, regardless of Zuph.\n\n2. **Zuph's Effect on Jyka**: Zuph has a direct effect on Jyka. However, we are told that Zuph causes not Jyka, which implies that the presence of Zuph is associated with Jyka being absent or having a negative effect on Jyka.\n\n3. **Jyka's Effect on Glimx**: Jyka has a direct effect on Glimx. This means that Jyka can influence Glimx directly.\n\n4. **Zory or Jyka Causes Glimx**: We know that either Zory or Jyka can cause Glimx. Given that Zory has a direct effect on Glimx, if Zory is observed, it could directly cause Glimx, regardless of the state of Zuph.\n\n5. **Given Condition**: We are given that an individual is Zory. This means that Zory is present and could directly affect Glimx.\n\nGiven these conditions, even if Zuph were not present (i.e., not zuph instead of zuph), Zory",
