	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%. Is wet ground more likely than dry ground overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, wet ground is not more likely than dry ground overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the overall probability of wet ground, we need to consider both scenarios: when there is a full moon and when there is no full moon.\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Probability of Wet Ground Given No Full Moon**: This is given as 56%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Probability of Full Moon**: This is given as 16%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Probability of Wet Ground Given Full Moon**: This is given as 54%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Probability of No Full Moon**: Since the probability of a full moon is 16%, the probability of no full moon is \(1 - 0.16 = 0.84\).\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we calculate the overall probability of wet ground:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Probability of Wet Ground When There Is No Full Moon**: \(P(\text{Wet Ground} \mid \text{No Full Moon}) \times P(\text{No Full Moon}) = 0.56 \times 0.84 = 0.4704\).\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Probability of Wet Ground When There Is A Full Moon**: \(P(\text{Wet Ground} \mid \text{Full Moon}) \times P(\text{Full Moon}) = 0.54 \times 0.16 = 0.0864\).\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Overall Probability of Wet Ground**: Sum of both probabilities \(= 0.4704 + 0.0864 = 0.5568\).\\ \tt \\ \tt - **
