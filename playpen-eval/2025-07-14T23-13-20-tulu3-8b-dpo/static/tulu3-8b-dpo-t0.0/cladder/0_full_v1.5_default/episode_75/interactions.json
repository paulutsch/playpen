The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. The overall probability of jyka is 25%. The probability of not jyka and kwox is 71%. The probability of jyka and kwox is 24%. Is the chance of kwox smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Jyka) = 0.25\n- P(Not Jyka and Kwox) = 0.71\n- P(Jyka and Kwox) = 0.24\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of Kwox (P(Kwox)) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Kwox) = P(Kwox | Jyka) * P(Jyka) + P(Kwox | Not Jyka) * P(Not Jyka)\n\nWe know P(Jyka) = 0.25 and P(Not Jyka) = 1 - P(Jyka) = 0.75.\n\nWe also know P(Jyka and Kwox) = 0.24, which can be rewritten as P(Kwox | Jyka) * P(Jyka) = 0.24. Solving for P(Kwox | Jyka), we get:\n\nP(Kwox | Jyka) = 0.24 / 0.25 = 0.96\n\nNow, we need to find P(Kwox | Not Jyka). We know:\n\nP(Not Jyka and",
