Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of having low cholesterol is not necessarily larger when observing having a sister. \n\nTo understand this, we need to consider the causal relationships and probabilities given in the problem:\n\n1. **Direct Effects:**\n   - Unobserved confounders (U) affect both having a sister (S) and cholesterol level (C).\n   - Treatment assignment (T) affects having a sister (S).\n   - Having a sister (S) affects cholesterol level (C).\n\n2. **Probabilities:**\n   - Probability of having a sister (P(S=1)) = 20% = 0.2\n   - Probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol (P(S=0, C=low)) = 65% = 0.65\n   - Probability of having a sister and low cholesterol (P(S=1, C=low)) = 14% = 0.14\n\n3. **Calculation of Conditional Probabilities:**\n   - **Probability of low cholesterol given no sister (P(C=low|S=0)):**\n     \\[\n     P(C=low|S=0) = \\frac{P(S=0, C=low)}{P(S=0)} = \\frac{0.65}{1 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.65}{0.8} = 0.8125\n     \\]\n   - **Probability of low cholesterol given sister (P",
