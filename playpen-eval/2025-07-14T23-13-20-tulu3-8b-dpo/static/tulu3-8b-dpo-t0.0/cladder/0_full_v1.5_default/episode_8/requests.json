Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance and compare it to the probability of admission rejection.\n\nFirst, let's define the probabilities given:\n\n- Probability of being male (P(Male)) = 54% = 0.54\n- Probability of admission acceptance given not male (P(Admit | Not Male)) = 49% = 0.49\n- Probability of admission acceptance given male (P(Admit | Male)) = 24% = 0.24\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit)) using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(Admit) = P(Admit | Male) \\cdot P(Male) + P(Admit | Not Male) \\cdot P(Not Male) \\]\n\nWhere \\( P(Not Male) = 1 - P(Male) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46 \\).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(Admit) = (0.24 \\cdot 0.54) + (0.49 \\cdot 0.46) \\]\n\n\\[ P(Admit) = 0.1296 + 0.2254 \\]\n\n\\[ P(Admit) = 0.355 \\]\n\nSo, the overall probability of admission acceptance is 35.5%.\n\nNext, we calculate the",
