	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For people who have not visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 9%. For people who have not visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 54%. For people who have visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 46%. For people who have visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 90%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 17%. For people who have visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 27%. For people who have visited England, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the person had not visited England?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be less likely to see an employee being fired if they had not visited England.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this, we need to consider the probabilities given in the problem and understand the causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects:**\\ \tt    - CEO affects Director.\\ \tt    - Visiting England affects Employee.\\ \tt    - Director affects Employee.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Probabilities:**\\ \tt    - **Not Visited England, No Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 9%\\ \tt    - **Not Visited England, Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 54%\\ \tt    - **Visited England, No Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 46%\\ \tt    - **Visited England, Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 90%\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Probability of Termination Letter:**\\ \tt    - **Not Visited England:** 17% chance of signing a termination letter.\\ \tt    - **Visited England:** 27% chance of signing a termination letter.\\ \tt \\ \tt The key here is to understand the interaction between visiting England and the director's decision to sign a termination letter. Visiting England increases the likelihood of a director signing a termination letter (from 17% to 27%), and when a termination letter is signed, the probability of an employee being fired increases significantly (from 9% to 54% for those who haven't visited England, and from 46% to 90% for those who have visited England).\\ \tt \\ \tt **Reasoning:**\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Without Vis
