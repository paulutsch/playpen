If Zuph is present, it will increase the likelihood of Glimx being present.\n   - If Zuph is absent (not Zuph), this direct pathway from Jyka to Glimx through Zuph is blocked.\n\n5. **Effect of Zory**:\n   - Zory also has a direct effect on Glimx. Since Jyka directly causes Zory, Zory will be present when Jyka is present.\n   - Even if Zuph is absent, the presence of Zory (caused by Jyka)",
