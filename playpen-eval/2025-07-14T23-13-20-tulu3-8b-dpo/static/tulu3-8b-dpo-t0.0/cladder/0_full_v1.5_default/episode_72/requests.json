The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Cwoi has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. Cwoi is unobserved. For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%. For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%. For those who are not yomx, the probability of gwet is 64%. For those who are yomx, the probability of gwet is 8%.

For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%.\n2. For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%.\n3. For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%.\n4. For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%.\n\nWe also know the probability of gwet given yomx (P(gwet|yomx)) is 8%, and given not yomx (P(gwet|not yomx)) is 64%.\n\nTo determine if being yomx affects the likelihood of observing xevu, we need to consider the overall probability of xevu given yomx (P(xevu|yomx)) compared to the overall probability of xevu given not yomx (P(xevu|not yomx)).\n\nFirst, calculate P(xevu|yomx):\n\nP(xevu|yomx) = P(xevu|yomx and gwet) * P(gwet|yomx) + P(xevu|y",
