	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has low poverty. Would the person gets cholera if polluted water instead of clean water?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the person would not necessarily get cholera if they are served by a global water company and live in a region with low poverty, even if they were exposed to polluted water instead of clean water.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's the reasoning:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: We know from the problem statement that poverty directly affects water quality, water quality directly affects cholera contraction, and the water company also directly affects water quality.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Observed Conditions**: The person is served by a global water company and lives in a region with low poverty. Given that low poverty is associated with better water quality (since high poverty causes poor water quality), we can infer that the water provided by the global water company in this low-poverty region is likely to be clean.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Causal Chain**: Normally, the causal chain would go as follows: Low poverty → Clean water → Low risk of cholera.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Intervention**: The hypothetical scenario introduces polluted water instead of clean water. However, the direct effect of the global water company serving the region (which we observe) suggests that the water is typically clean. The presence of a global water company is a strong indicator of good water management practices, which would mitigate the risk of waterborne diseases like cholera.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. **Counterfactual Analysis**: In a counterfactual scenario where the water is polluted, we would expect an increased risk of cholera. However, given the observed conditions (low poverty and service by a global water company),
