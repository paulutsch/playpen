Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ X X\nX X X ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n<|assistant|>\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 square with various symbols. The top-left corner and bottom-right corner are marked with 'X'. The rest of the cells are either empty (▢) or filled with 'X'. The 'X' symbols form a shape that starts at the top-left, moves right, then down, and finally back to the right before ending at the bottom-right corner.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. The first row has an 'X' at the first and last positions, and '▢' (empty squares) in the middle three positions. The second row has 'X' in the first, third, and last positions, and '▢' in the second and fourth positions. The third row has 'X' in the first and last positions, and '▢' in the second and fourth positions. The fourth and fifth rows are identical, each having 'X' at the first and last positions, and '▢' in the middle three positions.<|end_of_text|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are there any 'X' symbols in the second and fourth columns of your grid?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, there are 'X' symbols in the second and fourth columns of my grid.<|end_of_text|>\nQUESTION: Are there any 'X' symbols in the third row of your grid?<|end_of_text|> Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: Yes, there is an 'X' in the third row of my grid, specifically in the first position.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
