Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢ symbols in your grid that are positioned directly adjacent to the edges of the grid, meaning they are in the first or last position of a row or column?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, in my grid, the ▢ symbols in the first and last positions of the first and fifth rows, and the ▢ symbols in the first and last positions of the second and fourth columns, are all positioned directly adjacent to the edges of the grid.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢ symbols in your grid that are positioned in the second or third position of a column, and are not in the same row as any other ▢ symbol in that column? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, in my grid, there are ▢ symbols in the second or third position of a column, and they are not in the same row as any other ▢ symbol in that column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDECISION: different grids<|eot_id|>",
