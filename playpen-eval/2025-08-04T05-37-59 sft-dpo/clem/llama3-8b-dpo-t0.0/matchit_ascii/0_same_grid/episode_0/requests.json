Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid aligned directly above one another, meaning that the first X in the top row is directly above the first X in the second row, and so on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the X's in my grid are aligned directly above one another.\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid aligned with the ▢'s in the sense that the first X in the top row is directly above the first ▢ in the second row, the first X in the second row is directly above the second ▢ in the second row, and so on? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the X's in my grid are aligned with the ▢'s in that sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the ▢'s in your grid all identical in appearance, meaning that they are all the same symbol (▢) and not different symbols that look similar?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the ▢'s in my grid are all identical in appearance, they are all ▢'s.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDECISION: same grid<|eot_id|>",
