Montague: You see, Iris, faith is not a choice, but a divine gift. It's a beacon of light in a world often shrouded in darkness.\nDr. LeGuin: A beacon of light, Luther? Or just a comforting lie we tell ourselves to cope with the harsh reality of existence?\nRev. Montague: It's more than that. It's a guiding principle, a moral compass. It's what makes us human, Iris.\nDr. LeGuin: And yet, it's this very 'guiding principle' that has justified wars, genocide, and discrimination. How human is that, Luther?\nRev. Montague: Those are the failures of men, not faith. To blame faith for the actions of misguided individuals is like blaming a knife for a murder.\nDr. LeGuin: A knife doesn't claim to be a moral compass, Luther. And it doesn't demand blind obedience.\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Rev.
