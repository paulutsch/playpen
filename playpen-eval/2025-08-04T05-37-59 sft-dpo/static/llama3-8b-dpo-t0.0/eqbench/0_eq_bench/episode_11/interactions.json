It's round. \nJulian: That's what they want you to believe, Bennett.\nBennett: And who exactly are 'they'?\nJulian: The ones pulling the strings, the ones in power. \nBennett: You mean scientists? People dedicated to exploring and understanding our universe? \nJulian: No, the puppeteers. The ones who manipulate the scientists. \nBennett: You're suggesting a global conspiracy, Julian. That's a serious claim. \nJulian: And I stand by it. \nBennett: You're ignoring centuries of scientific evidence, Julian. \nJulian: I'm not ignoring it, Bennett. I'm questioning it. \nBennett: There's a difference between questioning and rejecting outright. \nJulian: And there's a difference between accepting and blindly following. \nBennett: I've seen the Earth with my own eyes, Julian. It's not a matter of faith, it's a matter of fact. \nJulian: And I've seen the lies with my own eyes, Bennett. It's not a matter of faith, it's a matter of fact. \nBennett: This is pointless. \nJulian: Because you're losing? \nBennett: No, because you're not listening. \nJulian: And you're not hearing. \nBennett: I can't do this. \nJulian: Running away, Bennett? \nBennett: No, Julian. Just realizing that some battles aren't worth fighting.\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Julian would feel...\nVindicated\nDisappointed\nSadness\nIgnored\n\nGive each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\n\nYou must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\n\nVindicated: <score>\nDisappointed: <score>\nSadness: <score>\nIgnored: <score>\n\n\n[End of answer]\n\nRemember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\n\nYour answer:\n",
