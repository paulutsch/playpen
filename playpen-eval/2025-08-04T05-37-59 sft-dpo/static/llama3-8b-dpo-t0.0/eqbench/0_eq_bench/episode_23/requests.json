Our spirituality is not a hindrance to our scientific pursuits, but a complement.\nAmelia: A complement? Spirituality is the antithesis of science. It's unquantifiable, unprovable. It's a crutch for the weak-minded.\nXarlon: And yet, your civilization is rife with conflict, inequality, and suffering.
