Let's denote the frequency of the L^m allele as p and the frequency of the L^n allele as q. \n\nThe frequency of the MM and MN phenotypes is 392 + 336 = 728. This is the result of the genotype L^mL^n, which has a frequency of 2pq. \n\nThe frequency of the NN phenotype is 72, which is the result of the genotype L^mL^m, which has a frequency of p^2.\n\nWe can set up the following equations:\n\n2pq = 728\np^2 = 72\n\nSolving for p and q, we get:\n\np^2 = 72\np = sqrt(72) / 2 = 0.6 (approximately)\nq = 1 - p = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the frequency of the L^m allele is 0.6 and",
