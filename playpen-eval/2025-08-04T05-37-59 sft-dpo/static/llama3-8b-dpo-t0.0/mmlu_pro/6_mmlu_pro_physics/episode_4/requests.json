Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nOptions:\nA. 1000 times more\nB. 50 times more\nC. 5000 times more\nD. 500 times more\nE. 10000 times more\nF. 20000 times more\nG. 2000 times more\nH. 100 times more\nI. 10 times more\nJ. N/A\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nOptions:\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD.
