Assuming a constant intrest rate of 9% compounded quarterly, what is the theoretial forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months?\nOptions:\nA. 448.25\nB. 465.75\nC. 435.67\nD. 442.02\nE. 455.90\nF. 460.30\nG. 450.50\nH. 438.88\nI. 427.15\nJ. 470.10<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve the last question, we need to calculate the theoretical forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months. \n\nFirst, we need to find the number of periods (n) and the interest rate per period (i). \nn = 9 months / 3 months = 3 periods (since interest is compounded quarterly)\ni = 9%/4 = 2.25% per quarter\n\nThe storage cost is $2 per ounce per year, payable quarterly in advance. So, the quarterly storage cost is $2/4 = $0.50 per ounce.\n\nThe current price of gold is $412 per ounce. The storage cost for 3 quarters is $0.50 * 3 = $1.50 per ounce.\n\nThe theoretical forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months is the sum of the current price and the storage cost for 3 quarters, plus the interest on the current price for 3 quarters.\n\nThe interest on the current price for 3 quarters is calculated as follows:\nInterest = $412 * (1 + 0.0225)^3 - $412\nInterest ≈ $412 * 1.070625 - $412\nInterest ≈ $441.59 - $412\nInterest ≈ $29.59\n\nThe theoretical forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months is:\n$412 + $1.50 + $29.59\n$412 + $31.09\n$443.09\n\nHowever, this is",
