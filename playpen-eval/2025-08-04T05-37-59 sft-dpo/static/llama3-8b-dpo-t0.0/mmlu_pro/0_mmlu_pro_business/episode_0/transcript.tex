	 To find Mr. Howard's tax for each need, we need to calculate the tax for each category and then add them up.\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Local college fund: 22% of $16,500 = 0.22 * $16,500 = $3,630. \\ \tt    Tax rate for local college fund: $0.41 per $100\\ \tt    Tax for local college fund: ($3,630 / 100) * $0.41 = $14.83\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. Special education: \\ \tt    Tax rate for special education: $0.02 per $100\\ \tt    Tax for special education: ($3,630 / 100) * $0.02 = $0.73\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Health and welfare: \\ \tt    Tax rate for health and welfare: $0.001 per $100\\ \tt    Tax for health and welfare: ($3,630 / 100) * $0.001 = $0.0363\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. Community construction: \\ \tt    Tax rate for community construction: $0.089 per $100\\ \tt    Tax for community construction: ($3,630 / 100) * $0.089 = $3.23\\ \tt \\ \tt Total tax: $14.83 + $0.73 + $0.0363 + $3.23 = $18.88\\ \tt \\ \tt The answer is (C)
