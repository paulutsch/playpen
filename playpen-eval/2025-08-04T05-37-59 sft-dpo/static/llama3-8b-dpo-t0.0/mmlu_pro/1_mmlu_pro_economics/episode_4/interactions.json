Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nFor a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will\nOptions:\nA. Never occur\nB. Persist indefinitely\nC. Cause a permanent change in the trend\nD. Grow exponentially\nE. Only affect the next period\nF. Eventually die away\nG. Cause the process to become non-stationary\nH. Immediately disappear\nI. Lead to a cyclical pattern\nJ. Be balanced out by subsequent shocks\nThe answer is (F)\n\nQuestion:\nConsider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by\nOptions:\nA. 0.45\nB. 0.2\nC. 0.4\nD. 0.1\nE. 0.3\nF. 0.55\nG. 0.25\nH. 0.33\nI. 0.6\nJ. 0.5\nThe answer is (H)\n\nQuestion:\nSuppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\nOptions:\nA. (iii) and (iv) only\nB. (i) and (iv) only\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\nD. (i) and (ii) only\nE. (i) and (iii) only\nF. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\nG. (ii), (iii), and (iv) only\nH. (ii) and (iii) only\nI. (ii) and (iv) only\nJ. (i), (iii), and (iv) only\nThe answer is (C)\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following policies best describes supply-side fiscal policy?\nOptions:\nA. Higher taxes on household income\nB. Increased government spending\nC. Increased taxes on corporate profits\nD. Increased import tariffs\nE. Decreased interest rates\nF. Lower taxes on consumer goods\nG. Lower taxes on research and development of new technology\nH. Reduced government spending\nI. Higher taxes on capital gains\nJ.

N/A\nThe answer is (F)\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is utility? What is marginal utility?\nOptions:\nA. Utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure. Marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed.\nB. Utility is the quantity of a product. Marginal utility is the increase in quantity which a consumer gets from an additional unit of a specific good.\nC. Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.\nD. Utility is the duration of time a product can be used. Marginal utility is the increase in usage time with each additional unit consumed.\nE. Utility is the measure of scarcity of a good. Marginal utility is the change in scarcity when one more unit of the good is produced.\nF. Utility is the weight of a product. Marginal utility is the additional weight a consumer perceives when purchasing an extra unit of a specific good.\nG. Utility is the power to make a good. Marginal utility is the extra power which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.\nH. Utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed, holding the level of consumption constant.\nI. Utility is the price of a good. Marginal utility is the increase in price which a consumer pays for an additional unit of a specific good.\nJ. Utility is the demand for a product. Marginal utility is the change in demand as the supply of a specific good increases.\n",
