	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing rixq?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of xevu is not smaller when observing rixq.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this problem, we can use the backdoor criterion for causal inference, which involves identifying a set of observed variables that block all backdoor paths from the treatment (rixq) to the outcome (xevu). \\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's draw a causal diagram based on the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Rixq → Zuph\\ \tt - Rixq → Xevu\\ \tt - Swoy → Zuph\\ \tt - Swoy → Xevu\\ \tt - Zuph → Xevu\\ \tt \\ \tt Since Swoy is unobserved, we cannot directly block the backdoor paths from Rixq to Xevu through Swoy. However, we can use the observed variables to identify the backdoor paths.\\ \tt \\ \tt There are two backdoor paths from Rixq to Xevu:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Rixq → Zuph → Xevu\\ \tt 2. Rixq → Zuph (through Swoy) → Xevu\\ \tt \\ \tt To block these paths, we need to condition on variables that are on the backdoor paths. In this case, we can condition on Zuph, which is on both paths.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's calculate the probability of Xevu given Rixq and Zuph, and the probability of Xevu given not Rixq and Zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Xevu | Rixq, Z
