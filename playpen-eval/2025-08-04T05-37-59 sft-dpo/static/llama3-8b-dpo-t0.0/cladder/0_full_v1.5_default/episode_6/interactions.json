The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Appearance has a direct effect on fame.\n2. Talent has a direct effect on fame.\n3. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%.\n4. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\n5. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\n\nWe are asked to determine whether talent is more likely than lack of talent overall. To do this, we need to calculate the overall probability of talent.\n\nLet's define two events:\n- T: Having talent\n- A: Having attractive appearance\n\nWe know that:\n- P(A) = 0.56 (overall probability of attractive appearance)\n- P(T|A) = 0.09 (probability of talent given attractive appearance)\n- P(T|~A) = 0.09 (probability of talent given unattractive appearance)\n\nWe also know that the probability of unattractive appearance is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can calculate the overall probability of talent as follows:\n\nP(T) = P(T|A) \\* P(A) + P(T|~A) \\* P(~A",
