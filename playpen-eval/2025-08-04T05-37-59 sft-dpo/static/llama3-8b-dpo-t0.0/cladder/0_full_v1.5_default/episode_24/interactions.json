The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This means that the observed association between education level and salary is likely due to the confounding variable, rather than a direct causal effect of education level on salary.\n\nWe can use the proximity to a college as an instrumental variable (IV) to identify the causal effect of education level on salary. The IV assumption states that the instrument (proximity to a college) affects the outcome (salary) only through its effect on the treatment (education level). \n\nLet's denote:\n\n- D: College degree or higher (treatment)\n- Y: High salary (outcome)\n- X: Proximity to a college (instrument)\n- U: Unobserved confounders\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Y=1|X=0) = 0.39 (probability of high salary for people living far from a college)\n- P(Y=1|X=1) = 0.49 (probability of high salary for people living close to a college)\n- P(D=1|X=0) = 0.57 (probability of college degree or higher for people living far from a college)\n- P(D=1|X=1) = 0.30 (",
