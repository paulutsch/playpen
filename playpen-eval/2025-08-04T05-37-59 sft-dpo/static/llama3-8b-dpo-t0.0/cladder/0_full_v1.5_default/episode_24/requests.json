The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means that the observed association between education level and salary is likely due to the confounding variable, rather than a direct causal effect of education level on salary.\n\nWe can use the proximity to a college as an instrumental variable (IV) to identify the causal effect of education level on salary. The IV assumption states that the instrument (proximity to a college) affects the outcome (salary) only through its effect on the treatment (education level). \n\nLet's denote:\n\n- D: College degree or higher (treatment)\n- Y: High salary (outcome)\n- X: Proximity to a college (instrument)\n- U: Unobserved confounders\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Y=1|X=0) = 0.39 (probability of high salary for people living far from a college)\n- P(Y=1|X=1) = 0.49 (probability of high salary for people living close to a college)\n- P(D=1|X=0) = 0.57 (probability of college degree or higher for people living far from a college)\n- P(D=1|X=1) = 0.30 (",
