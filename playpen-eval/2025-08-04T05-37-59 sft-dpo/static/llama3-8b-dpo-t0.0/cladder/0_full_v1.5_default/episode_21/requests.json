Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. The probability of waking up late is 5%.\n2. When Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%.\n3. When Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%.\n\nWe want to compare the overall probability of arriving to school on time versus arriving to school late. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes for each scenario.\n\nLet's define two potential outcomes:\n\n- P(A|W): The probability of arriving to school on time given that Alice wakes up on time.\n- P(A|L): The probability of arriving to school on time given that Alice wakes up late.\n\nWe are given that P(A|W) = 0.52 and P(A|L) = 0.87.\n\nTo find the overall probability of arriving to school on time, we need to consider the probability of waking up on time and the probability of waking up late, and then apply the law of total probability:\n\nP(A) = P(W) \\* P(A|W) + P(L) \\* P(A|L)\n= 0.95 \\* 0.52 + 0.05 \\* ",
