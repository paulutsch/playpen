The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tijv has a direct effect on tijw and xevo. Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. For those who are not tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 29%. For those who are not tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 14%. For those who are tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 11%. For those who are tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 16%. The overall probability of tijv is 88%. Will xevo increase the chance of gyzp?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's define the following:\n\n- P(gyzp|not tijv, not xevo) = 0.29 (probability of gyzp among those who are not tijv and not xevo)\n- P(gyzp|not tijv, xevo) = 0.14 (probability of gyzp among those who are not tijv and xevo)\n- P(gyzp|tijv, not xevo) = 0.11 (probability of gyzp among those who are tijv and not xevo)\n- P(gyzp|tijv, xevo) = 0.16 (probability of gyzp among those who are tijv and xevo)\n- P(tijv) = 0.88 (probability of tijv)\n\nWe can estimate the probability of gyzp among those who are xevo by considering two scenarios:\n\n1.
