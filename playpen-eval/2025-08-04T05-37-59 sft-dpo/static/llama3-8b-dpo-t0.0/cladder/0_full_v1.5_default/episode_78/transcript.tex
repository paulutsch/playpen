	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, zuph will not increase the chance of uvzi.\\ \tt \\ \tt To assess the causal effect of zuph on uvzi, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of wibl. Given that wibl has a direct effect on both vubr and zuph, and both vubr and zuph have a direct effect on uvzi, wibl is a confounder in this scenario.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect of zuph on uvzi. The backdoor criterion states that a path from zuph to uvzi is blocked if we condition on all variables that are direct causes of zuph and all variables that are direct causes of uvzi, except for zuph itself.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's define the following variables:\\ \tt \\ \tt - W: wibl\\ \tt - Z: zuph\\ \tt - V: vubr\\ \tt - U: uvzi\\ \tt \\ \tt We have the following direct causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - W → V\\ \tt - W → Z\\ \tt - Z → U\\ \tt - V → U\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the following conditional probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(U|not W, not Z) = 0.77\\ \tt - P(U|not W, Z) = 0.63\\ \tt - P(U|W, not Z) = 0.54\\ \tt - P(U|W, Z) = 0.76\\ \tt \\ \tt We also know that P(W) = 0.23.
