The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Will waking up late increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of arriving to school on time might be higher when Alice wakes up late because, on days when she wakes up late, traffic is more likely to be lighter, allowing her to arrive on time. This is a classic example of a confounding variable, where the association between the treatment (waking up late) and the outcome (arriving to school on time) is due to a third variable (traffic).\n\nTo establish a causal relationship, we would need to control for the effect of traffic or use a different study design that can isolate the effect of waking up late. Without such control, we cannot conclude that waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time.",
