Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 88%. For people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. For people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 58%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 13%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 9%. For people who have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 64%.

We are given that P(set alarm|no brother) = 9% and P(set alarm|brother) = 64%. \n\nNext, we can calculate the probability of the alarm ringing given that the wife does not set the alarm (P(ring|not set)) and the probability of the alarm ringing given that the wife sets the alarm (P(ring|set)). We are given the following probabilities: \n- P(ring|not set) = 88% for people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm\n- P(ring|set) = 45% for people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm\n- P(ring|not set) = 58% for people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm\n- P(ring|set) = 13% for people who have a brother",
