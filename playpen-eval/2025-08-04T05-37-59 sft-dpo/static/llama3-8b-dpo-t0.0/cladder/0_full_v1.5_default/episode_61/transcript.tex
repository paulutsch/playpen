	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether the chance of brown eyes is larger when observing encouragement, we need to calculate the probability of brown eyes given encouragement (P(Brown|Encouragement)) and compare it to the overall probability of brown eyes (P(Brown)).\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's calculate P(Brown|Encouragement) using the formula for conditional probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Brown|Encouragement) = P(Encouragement and Brown) / P(Encouragement)\\ \tt = 58% / 91%\\ \tt = 0.637\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, let's calculate the overall probability of brown eyes (P(Brown)):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Brown) = P(Encouragement and Brown) + P(Encouragement and not Brown) + P(not Encouragement and Brown)\\ \tt = 58% + (1 - 91%) * (1 - 7%) + 7%\\ \tt = 58% + 0.08 * 0.93 + 7%\\ \tt = 58% + 0.0744 + 7%\\ \tt = 65.0744%\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we can compare P(Brown|Encouragement) to P(Brown):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Brown|Encouragement) = 0.637\\ \tt P(Brown) = 0.650744\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(Brown) is greater than P(Brown|Encouragement), the chance of brown eyes is not larger when observing encouragement. In fact, the overall probability of brown eyes
