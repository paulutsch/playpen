The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is tijw. Would an individual is not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is equivalent to asking whether the absence of xevo would prevent gyzp, given that tijw is observed.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the backdoor paths from xevo to gyzp. The backdoor path is tijv, which is a common effect of both xevo and tijw. \n\nHowever, since we know that tijw causes tijv, and tijw is observed, the effect of xevo on gyzp through tijv is blocked. \n\nIn other words, even if xevo were absent, the causal effect of tijw on gyzp through tijv would still be present, because tijw",
