The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a manager signing the termination letter is 35%.\n2. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of the employee being fired is 76%.\n3. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of the employee being fired is 42%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of the employee being fired by considering two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Manager signs the termination letter (35% probability)\n  - In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 42%.\n- Scenario 2: Manager doesn't sign the termination letter (65% probability, since 100% - 35% = 65%)\n  - In this case, the probability of the employee being fired is 76%.\n\nTo find the overall probability of the employee being fired, we need to calculate the weighted average of the two scenarios:\n\nOverall probability of employee being fired = (Probability of manager signing the termination letter * Probability of employee being fired in this scenario) + (Probability of manager not signing the termination letter * Probability of employee being fired in this scenario)\n= (0.35 * 0.42) + (0.65 * 0.76)\n= 0.147 + 0.494\n= 0.641\n\nNow, to determine if the employee is more likely to be fired than not fired overall",
