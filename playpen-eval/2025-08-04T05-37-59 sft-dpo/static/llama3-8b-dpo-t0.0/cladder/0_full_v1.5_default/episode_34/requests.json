Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For people who have not visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 9%. For people who have not visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 54%. For people who have visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 46%. For people who have visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 90%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 17%. For people who have visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 27%. For people who have visited England, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the person had not visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are asked to compare the probability of an employee being fired in the actual world (where the employee has visited England) to the probability of an employee being fired in a counterfactual world (where the employee had not visited England).\n\nLet's denote the following:\n\n- A: \"Having visited England\"\n- B: \"Being fired\"\n- C: \"Director signs termination letter\"\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(B|A, C=0) = 46% (employee fired, given visited England and director didn't sign termination letter)\n- P(B|A, C=1) = 90% (employee fired, given visited England and director signed termination letter)\n- P(B|A', C=0) = 9% (employee fired, given not visited England and director didn't sign termination letter)\n- P(B|A', C=1) = 54% (employee fired, given not visited England and director signed termination letter)\n- P(C=1|A') = 17% (director signs termination letter, given not visited England)\n- P(C=1|A) = 27% (director signs termination letter, given visited England)\n\nTo estimate the probability of an employee being",
