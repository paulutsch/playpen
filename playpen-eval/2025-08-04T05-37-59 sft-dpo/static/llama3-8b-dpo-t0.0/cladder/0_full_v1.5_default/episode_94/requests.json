However, we are given that the individual is not Tijv.\n\nTo determine whether the individual would be gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo, we need to consider the counterfactual scenario where Xevo is absent. In this scenario, the individual's gyzp outcome would be solely determined by Tijv (since Tijv is the only other causal factor).\n\nHowever, since the individual is not Tijv, we can conclude that even if Xevo were absent, the individual would not be gyzp. This is because the absence of Xevo would not introduce any new causal effect on gyzp, and the individual's gyzp outcome would still be determined by the absence",
