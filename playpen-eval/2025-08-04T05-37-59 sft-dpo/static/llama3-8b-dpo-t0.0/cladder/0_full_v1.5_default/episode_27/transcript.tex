	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of an intelligent child is not smaller when observing intelligent parents.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the problem of selection bias. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote the variables as follows:\\ \tt - P: Parents' intelligence (binary: intelligent or unintelligent)\\ \tt - S: Parents' social status (binary: high or low)\\ \tt - C: Child's intelligence (binary: intelligent or unintelligent)\\ \tt - U: Other unobserved factors (binary: present or absent)\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the conditions:\\ \tt 1. P → S (Parents' intelligence affects parents' social status)\\ \tt 2. P → C (Parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence)\\ \tt 3. S → C (Parents' social status affects child's intelligence)\\ \tt 4. U → S (Other unobserved factors affect parents' social status)\\ \tt 5. U → C (Other unobserved factors affect child's intelligence)\\ \tt 6. P ~ U (Parents' intelligence and other unobserved factors are independent)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt - P(intelligent) = 0.15\\ \tt - P(C(intelligent) & P(unintelligent)) = 0.54\\ \tt - P(C(intelligent) & P(intelligent)) = 0.04\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether the chance of an intelligent child is smaller when observing intelligent parents, we need to compare the conditional probability of C(intelligent) given P(intelligent) with the unconditional probability
