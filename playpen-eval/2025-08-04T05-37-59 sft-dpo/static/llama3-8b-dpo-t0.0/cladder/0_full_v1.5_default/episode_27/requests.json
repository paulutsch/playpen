The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

P → S (Parents' intelligence affects parents' social status)\n2. P → C (Parents' intelligence affects child's intelligence)\n3. S → C (Parents' social status affects child's intelligence)\n4. U → S (Other unobserved factors affect parents' social status)\n5. U → C (Other unobserved factors affect child's intelligence)\n6. P ~ U (Parents' intelligence and other unobserved factors are independent)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- P(intelligent) = 0.15\n- P(C(intelligent) & P(unintelligent)) = 0.54\n- P(C(intelligent) & P(intelligent)) = 0.04\n\nTo determine whether the chance of an intelligent child is smaller when observing intelligent parents, we need to compare the conditional probability of C(intelligent) given P(intelligent) with the unconditional probability",
