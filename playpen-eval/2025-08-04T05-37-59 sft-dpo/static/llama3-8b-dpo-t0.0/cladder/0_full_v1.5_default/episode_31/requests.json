The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We need to check if the effect of the gene on lung cancer through smoking is unconfounded.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- G: Gene (smoking or nonsmoking)\n- S: Smoking status (smoker or nonsmoker)\n- L: Lung cancer status (yes or no)\n- P: Pollution level (high or low)\n\nWe are interested in the effect of G on L through S. To check if this effect is unconfounded, we need to see if the following condition holds:\n\nP(G, S, L) = P(G|P) * P(S|G, P) * P(L|S, G, P)\n\nHowever, since pollution is unobserved, we cannot directly calculate this. Instead, we can use the backdoor criterion with the observed data.\n\nWe can use the following formula to estimate the effect of G on L through S:\n\nP(L|G, S) = P(L|G, S, P=high) * P(P=high|G, S) + P(L|G, S, P=low) * P(P=low|G, S)\n\nWe can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n\n- P(L|G, S, P=high) and P(L|G, S",
