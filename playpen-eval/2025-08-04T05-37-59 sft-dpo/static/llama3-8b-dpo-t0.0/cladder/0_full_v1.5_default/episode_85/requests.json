Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 75%. The probability of not yomx and xevu is 22%. The probability of yomx and xevu is 56%.

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(yomx) = 0.75\n2. P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n3. P(yomx and xevu) = 0.56\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we can calculate the probability of xevu as follows:\n\nP(xevu) = P(yomx and xevu) + P(not yomx and xevu)\n= 0.56 + 0.22\n= 0.78\n\nNow, we need to calculate P(xevu|yomx). We can use the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(xevu|yomx) = P(xevu and yomx) / P(yomx)\n= P(yomx and xevu) / P(yomx)\n= 0.56 / 0.75\n= 0.7467\n\nTo determine if the chance of xevu is smaller when observing yomx, we need to compare P(xevu|yomx) with P(xevu).
