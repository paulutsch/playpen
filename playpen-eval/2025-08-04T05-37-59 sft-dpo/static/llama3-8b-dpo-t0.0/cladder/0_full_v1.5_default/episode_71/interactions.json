The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%. Will yomx increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Direct effect of yomx on xevu\n2. Indirect effect of yomx on xevu through gwet\n\nWe need to consider the conditional probabilities given in the problem statement. \n\nFor those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. This serves as our baseline probability.\n\nNow, let's compare the probabilities of xevu for different groups:\n\n- For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%, which is lower than the baseline probability of 82%.\n- For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%, which is also lower than the baseline probability of 82%.\n- For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%, which is lower than the baseline probability of 82%.\n\nThe fact that the probability of xevu is lower in all groups where yomx is present (compared to the baseline probability) suggests that yom",
