This implies that the presence of a brother can influence the wife's behavior, which in turn affects the alarm clock. However, we also know that the probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. This suggests that having a brother does not directly cause the alarm to ring.\n\nNext, we are given that the probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. This is a crucial piece of information, as it provides a baseline probability of the alarm ringing in the absence of a brother.\n\nTo determine whether the presence of a brother increases the probability of the alarm ringing, we need to consider the probability of having a brother and not ringing alarm, as well as the probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm. Since the probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%, the probability of having a brother and not ringing alarm is 1% (the overall probability of having a brother).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of ringing alarm given having a brother (P(Ring|Brother)) as follows:\n\nP(Ring|Brother) = P(Ring and Brother) / P(Brother)\n= 0% / 1%\n= 0%\n\nSimilarly,",
