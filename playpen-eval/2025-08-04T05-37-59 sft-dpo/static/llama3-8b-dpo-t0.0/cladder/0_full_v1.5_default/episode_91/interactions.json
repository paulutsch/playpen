The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on zory and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 34%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 64%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 28%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. J has a direct effect on Z and U.\n2. U has a direct effect on G.\n3. Z has a direct effect on G.\n4. P(U) = 0.34\n5. P(¬U ∩ G) = 0.64\n6. P(U ∩ G) = 0.28\n\nWe want to determine if the chance of G is smaller when observing U. To do this, we need to compare the conditional probability P(G|U) with P(G|¬U).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(G) as follows:\n\nP(G) = P(G|U)P(U) + P(G|¬U)P(¬U)\n\nWe are given P(U) = 0.34 and P(¬U) = 1 - P(U) = 0.66. We also know that P(G ∩ U) = 0.28 and P(¬U ∩ G) = 0.64.\n\nTo find P(G",
