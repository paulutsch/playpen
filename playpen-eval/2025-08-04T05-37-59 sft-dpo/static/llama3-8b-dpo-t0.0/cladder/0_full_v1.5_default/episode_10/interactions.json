The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 76%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 22%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Smoking has a direct effect on effort (S → E).\n2. Effort has a direct effect on college admission (E → A).\n3. For nonsmokers (S = 0), the probability of college admission (A) is 76% (P(A|S=0) = 0.76).\n4. For smokers (S = 1), the probability of college admission (A) is 22% (P(A|S=1) = 0.22).\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of college admission for smokers (S = 1) with what it would be if they were nonsmokers (S = 0). This is a counterfactual question, which can be addressed using the potential outcomes framework.\n\nLet's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\n- A0: College admission if the individual is a nonsmoker (S = 0)\n- A1: College admission if the individual is a smoker (S = 1)\n\nWe are interested in the probability of A0 for individuals who are smokers (S",
