	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, manager signing the termination letter will not increase the chance of large feet.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of mediation analysis. We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. CEO has a direct effect on director and manager.\\ \tt 2. Manager has a direct effect on foot size.\\ \tt 3. Director has a direct effect on foot size.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are also given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(Large feet | Fire, Not sign) = 62%\\ \tt - P(Large feet | Fire, Sign) = 15%\\ \tt - P(Large feet | Fire, Not sign) = 83%\\ \tt - P(Large feet | Fire, Sign) = 35%\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to know the effect of manager signing the termination letter on the probability of large feet.\\ \tt \\ \tt To do this, we can use the concept of mediation analysis. We can estimate the effect of manager signing the termination letter on foot size by comparing the probabilities of large feet when the manager signs the termination letter versus when they do not.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, we need to be careful about the confounding variable, which is the CEO's decision to fire the employee. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. This means that the decision to fire is strongly associated with the outcome of interest (large feet).\\ \tt \\ \tt To estimate the effect of manager signing the termination letter, we can use the following formula:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Large feet | Sign) - P(Large feet |
