	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Qwiu has a direct effect on jyka and kwox. Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes not yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox. We observed an individual is qwiu. Would an individual is kwox if jyka instead of not jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of causal graphs and the backdoor criterion. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given the causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Qwiu → Jyka\\ \tt - Jyka → Yupt\\ \tt - Yupt → Kwox\\ \tt - Qwiu → Kwox\\ \tt - Jyka → Kwox\\ \tt \\ \tt We know that Qwiu is unobserved, and we observe an individual with Qwiu. We are asked to compare the effect of Jyka instead of not Jyka on Kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the causal effect of Jyka on Kwox, we need to consider the backdoor paths from Jyka to Kwox. There are two backdoor paths:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Jyka → Yupt → Kwox\\ \tt 2. Jyka → Kwox (direct effect)\\ \tt \\ \tt However, we also have a backdoor path from Qwiu to Kwox, which is not blocked by the observed Qwiu. This is because Qwiu is a common cause of both Jyka and Kwox, and observing Qwiu does not block the path from Qwiu to Kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt To identify the causal effect of Jyka on Kwox, we need to apply the backdoor criterion, which states that a path is blocked if all its intermediate variables are observed, or if the path is blocked by a collider
