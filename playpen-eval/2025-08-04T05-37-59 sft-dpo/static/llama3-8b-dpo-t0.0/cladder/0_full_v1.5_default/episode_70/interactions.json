The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijw and tijv. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. The overall probability of xevo is 48%. For those who are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 39%. For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%. Is gyzp more likely than not gyzp overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
