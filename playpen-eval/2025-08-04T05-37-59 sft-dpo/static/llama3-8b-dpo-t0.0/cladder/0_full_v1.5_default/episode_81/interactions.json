The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 3%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 78%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 2%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we can use the given probabilities to infer the relationship between Rixq and Xevu.\n\nLet's denote the probability of Xevu as P(Xevu) and the probability of Rixq as P(Rixq) = 0.03.\n\nWe are given that P(¬Rixq, Xevu) = 0.78 and P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.02.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of Xevu given Rixq (P(Xevu|Rixq)) as follows:\n\nP(Xevu|Rixq) = P(Rixq, Xevu) / P(Rixq) = 0.02 / 0.03 ≈ 0.6667\n\nWe can also calculate the probability of Xevu given not Rixq (P(Xevu|¬Rixq)) as follows:\n\nP",
