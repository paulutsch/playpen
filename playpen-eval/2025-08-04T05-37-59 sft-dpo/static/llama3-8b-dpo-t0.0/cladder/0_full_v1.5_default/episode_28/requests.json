Let's denote the variables as follows: \n\n- S: Smoking status (1 for smokers, 0 for nonsmokers)\n- E: Effort (1 for high effort, 0 for low effort)\n- A: College admission (1 for admitted, 0 for not admitted)\n\nGiven conditions:\n1. Smoking has a direct effect on effort (S → E).\n2. Effort has a direct effect on college admission (E → A).\n3. For nonsmokers (S = 0), the probability of college admission (P(A|S=0)) is 67%.\n4. For smokers (S = 1), the probability of college admission (P(A|S=1)) is 55%.\n\nWe want to know whether it would be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker, given that they are a smoker. This is essentially asking whether the probability of college admission would decrease if we were to intervene and make the smoker a nonsmoker.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the potential outcomes under different scenarios. Let's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\n\n- A0: College admission if the individual is a nonsmoker\n- A1: College admission if the individual is a smoker\n\nWe are interested in the probability of A0 given A1, i.e., P(A0|A1).
