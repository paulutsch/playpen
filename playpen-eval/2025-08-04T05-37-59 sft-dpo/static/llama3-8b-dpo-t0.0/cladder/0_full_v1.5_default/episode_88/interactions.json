The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on wibl. Uvzi has a direct effect on wibl. Method 1: We look directly at how zuph correlates with uvzi in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to wibl. To understand how zuph affects uvzi, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is known as the \"omitted variable problem\" or \"confounding\" in causal inference. Since both zuph and uvzi have a direct effect on wibl, their correlation may be influenced by the level of wibl, rather than any direct causal relationship between zuph and uvzi.\n\nIn contrast, Method 2, which looks at the correlation between zuph and uvzi case by case according to wibl, can help to control for the confounding effect of wibl. By stratifying the analysis by wibl, we can estimate the effect of zuph on uvzi while holding wibl constant, which can provide a more accurate estimate of the causal relationship between zuph and uvzi.\n\nThis is an example of the \"principal stratification\" approach, which is a technique used in causal inference to control for confounding variables by stratifying the analysis according to the level of the confounding variable. By using Method 2, we can avoid the confounding effect of wibl and obtain a more accurate estimate of the causal relationship between z",
