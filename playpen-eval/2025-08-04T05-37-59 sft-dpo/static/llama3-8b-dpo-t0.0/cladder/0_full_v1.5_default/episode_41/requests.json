Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. P(E ≥ college) = 0.06 (probability of college degree or higher)\n2. P(E ≤ high school) = 1 - P(E ≥ college) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 (probability of high school degree or lower)\n3. P(E ≤ high school, B) = 0.25 (probability of high school degree or lower and black hair)\n4. P(E ≥ college, B) = 0.03 (probability of college degree or higher and black hair)\n\nWe want to compare the probability of black hair (B) when observing college degree or higher (E ≥ college) to the overall probability of black hair. To do this, we need to calculate the probability of black hair given college degree or higher, P(B|E ≥ college).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(B|E ≥ college) = P(B, E ≥ college) / P(E ≥ college)\n= P(E ≥ college, B) / P(E ≥ college)\n= 0.03 / 0.06\n",
