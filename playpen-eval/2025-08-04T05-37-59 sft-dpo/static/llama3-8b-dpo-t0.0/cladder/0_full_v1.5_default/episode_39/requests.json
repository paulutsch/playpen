Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size.\n2. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size.\n3. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%.\n4. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%.\n5. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.\n\nWe are asked to determine whether large feet are more likely than small feet overall. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes for individuals who did and did not receive tanning salon treatment.\n\nLet's define two potential outcomes:\n\n- Y = 1 if an individual has large feet\n- Y = 0 if an individual has small feet\n\nWe can define the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Y=1|not treated) = 0.13 (probability of large feet for individuals not using tanning salon treatments)\n- P(Y=1|treated) = 0.70 (probability of large feet for individuals who used tanning salon treatments)\n\nSince the overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%, we can calculate the probability of large feet for the overall population as follows:\n\nP(Y=1) = P",
