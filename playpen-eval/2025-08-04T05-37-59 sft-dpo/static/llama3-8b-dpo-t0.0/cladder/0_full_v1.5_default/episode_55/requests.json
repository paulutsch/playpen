This is equivalent to asking if P(R=1|W=0) < P(R=1).\n\nTo answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of high rainfall given waking up late, P(R=1|W=0). We can use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(R=1|W=0) = P(W=0|R=1) * P(R=1) / P(W=0)\n\nHowever, we don't have the direct probability P(W=0|R=1). To find it, we can",
