Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Given the conditions:\n\n1. Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status.\n2. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status.\n3. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status.\n4. Residency status is unobserved.\n\nWe can represent these relationships using a causal graph:\n\n- Gender → Department Competitiveness\n- Residency Status → Department Competitiveness\n- Department Competitiveness → Admission Status\n\nSince Residency Status is unobserved, we cannot directly estimate its effect on Admission Status. However, we can use the do-calculus to identify the total effect of Gender on Admission Status.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- P(A=1|G=1) as the probability of admission acceptance given male gender (65%)\n- P(A=1|G=0) as the probability of admission acceptance given non-male gender (61%)\n- P(G=1) as the probability of male gender (13%)\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express the overall probability of admission acceptance as:\n\nP(A=1) = P(G=1) * P(A=1|G=1) + P(G=0) * P(A=1|G=0)\n\nwhere P(G=0) = 1",
