To calculate this, we need to consider the probability of Kwox in two scenarios: when Jyka is present and when Jyka is absent.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer the following:\n\n- P(Kwox|Not Jyka) = P(Not Jyka and Kwox) / P(Not Jyka) = 0.71 / (1 - 0.25) = 0.71 / 0.75 = 0.9467\n- P(Kwox|Jyka) = P(Jyka and Kwox) / P(Jyka) = 0.24 / 0.25 = 0.96\n\nComparing the two conditional probabilities, we see that P(Kwox|Jyka) = 0",
