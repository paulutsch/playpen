The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To do this, we need to compare the conditional probability of C given S (P(C|S)) with the marginal probability of C (P(C)).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(C|S) as follows:\nP(C|S) = P(C|S,T)P(T|S) + P(C|S,~T)P(~T|S)\n\nWe know that P(S) = 0.2, P(~S) = 0.8, P(C,~S) = 0.65, and P(C,S) = 0.14. We also know that P(S|~T) = 0.2 (since the probability of having a sister is independent of treatment assignment given the unobserved confounders).\n\nWe can calculate P(C|S) as follows:\nP(C",
