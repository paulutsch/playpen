The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

U → E (U has a direct effect on E)\n2. U → F (U has a direct effect on F)\n3. E → F (E has a direct effect on F)\n4. P(E=1) = 0.47\n5. P(F=1, E=0) = 0.32\n6. P(F=1, E=1) = 0.10\n\nWe want to find P(F=1|E=1) compared to P(F=1). \n\nFirst, we can calculate the probability of large feet (F=1) using the law of total probability:\nP(F=1) = P(F=1, E=1) + P(F=1, E=0)\n= 0.10 + P(F=1|E=0) * P(E=0)\nSince P(E=0) = 1 - P(E=1) = 1 - 0.47 = 0.53\nP",
