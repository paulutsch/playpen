	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 59%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 28%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 29%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 77%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt To assess whether gender positively affects admission status through department competitiveness, we need to examine the causal relationship between gender, department competitiveness, and admission status. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, we need to establish the causal relationship between gender and department competitiveness. The given data shows that for individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 29%, while for individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 77%. This indicates a positive association between being male and being in a competitive department.\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, we need to examine the causal relationship between department competitiveness and admission status. The given data shows that for individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%, while for individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25%. This indicates a negative association between being in a competitive department and admission status for non-male individuals.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we need to examine the causal relationship between gender and admission status, while controlling for department competitiveness. We can do this by comparing the probability of admission acceptance for male and non-male individuals within each department competitiveness category.\\ \tt \\ \tt For non-competitive departments, the probability of admission acceptance is 59% for males and 58% for non-males, indicating no significant difference.\\ \tt \\ \tt For competitive departments, the probability of admission acceptance is 28% for males and 25% for non-males, indicating no significant difference.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since there is no significant difference in the
