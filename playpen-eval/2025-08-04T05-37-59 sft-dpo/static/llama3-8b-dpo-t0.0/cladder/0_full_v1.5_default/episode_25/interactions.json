The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 40%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 32%. Will male gender increase the chance of admission acceptance?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that male gender increases the chance of admission acceptance.",
