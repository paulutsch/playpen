The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%. For those who are yomx, would it be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are comparing the probability of xevu for individuals who are yomx to the probability of xevu for individuals who are not yomx, but in a hypothetical scenario where they are not yomx.\n\nLet P(xevu|yomx) be the probability of xevu given yomx, which is 0.4. Let P(xevu|not yomx) be the probability of xevu given not yomx, which is 0.68.\n\nWe want to know if it would be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx, but in a hypothetical scenario where they are not yomx. This is equivalent to comparing P(xevu|not yomx) to P(xevu|not yomx, yomx=0), where yomx=0 represents the hypothetical scenario where the individual is not yomx.\n\nHowever, since the effect of yomx on gwet and gwet on xevu is direct, and there are no unmentioned factors or causal relationships, we can apply the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect of yomx on xevu. \n\nThe backdoor criterion states that if we can block all backdoor paths from yomx to xevu, then the observed association between yom",
