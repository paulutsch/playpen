The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on wibl. Wibl has a direct effect on uvzi. We know that zuph causes not wibl, and we know that wibl causes not uvzi. Would an individual is not uvzi if zuph instead of not zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Given that Wibl causes not Uvzi, the absence of Wibl would imply the presence of Uvzi (because Wibl's absence would remove its causal effect preventing Uvzi).\n\nTherefore, if Zuph instead of not Zuph, the individual would be uvzi, not not uvzi.",
