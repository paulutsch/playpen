	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. We know that yupt or zupj causes muvq. We observed an individual is not zupj. Would an individual is muvq if yupt instead of not yupt?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt The given conditions imply that both Yupt and Zupj have a direct effect on Muvq, and that at least one of them causes Muvq. However, we are given that the individual is not Zupj. \\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the effect of Yupt on Muvq in this scenario, we can use the backdoor criterion for causal inference. The backdoor criterion states that if we can block all backdoor paths from Yupt to Muvq, then we can conclude that Yupt causes Muvq.\\ \tt \\ \tt In this case, since we know that Zupj causes Muvq, and the individual is not Zupj, we can block the backdoor path from Yupt to Muvq by conditioning on the absence of Zupj. This is because the absence of Zupj eliminates the backdoor path from Yupt to Muvq through Zupj.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, the question is asking whether the individual would be Muvq if Yupt instead of not Yupt. This is equivalent to asking whether the absence of Yupt causes Muvq. \\ \tt \\ \tt Since we have blocked the backdoor path from Yupt to Muvq, we can conclude that the absence of Yupt does not cause Muvq. Therefore, if Yupt instead of not Yupt, the individual would still not be Muvq.
