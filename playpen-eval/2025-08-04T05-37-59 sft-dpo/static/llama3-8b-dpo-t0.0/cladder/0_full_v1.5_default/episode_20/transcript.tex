	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, the chance of wet ground is larger when observing rainy season.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of conditional probability and the backdoor criterion. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's define the variables and their relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Let R be the event of a rainy season\\ \tt - Let S be the event of a sprinkler being on\\ \tt - Let W be the event of wet ground\\ \tt - Let D be the event of dry weather\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the conditions, we have the following direct effects:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(R) = 0.87 (probability of a rainy season)\\ \tt - P(D|R) = 1 - P(R) = 0.13 (probability of dry weather given a rainy season)\\ \tt - P(S|R) = 1 (probability of a sprinkler being on given a rainy season, since we assume people use sprinklers during rainy seasons)\\ \tt - P(S|D) = 0 (probability of a sprinkler being on given dry weather, since people wouldn't use sprinklers during dry weather)\\ \tt - P(W|R) = 0.5 (probability of wet ground given a rainy season)\\ \tt - P(W|S) = 0.5 (probability of wet ground given a sprinkler being on)\\ \tt - P(W|D) = 0.07 (probability of wet ground given dry weather)\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we want to find the probability of wet ground given a rainy season, P(W|R).
