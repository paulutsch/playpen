The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Hwax has a direct effect on rukz. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 9%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 18%. For those who are pexu, would it be less likely to see rukz if the individual was not pexu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We know that Pexu has a direct effect on rukz, and for those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 18%. This implies that Pexu is a cause of rukz, and its presence increases the probability of rukz.\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of rukz for those who are pexu with the probability of rukz if they were not pexu. To do this, we need to consider the counterfactual probability, i.e., the probability of rukz if the individual was not pexu.\n\nSince Hwax also has a direct effect on rukz, we can assume that the effect of Pexu on rukz is not the only factor determining the probability of rukz. However, we do not have information about the effect of Hwax on rukz for those who are not pexu.\n\nGiven that for those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 9%, we can infer that the presence of Pexu increases the probability of rukz by 9% (18% - 9%). However, this does not necessarily mean that if an individual who is pexu were not pexu, the probability of rukz would be 9%. \n\nIn fact, the question is asking us to compare the probability of rukz for those who are pex",
