The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we can use the observed variables to block the backdoor paths.\n\nWe can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect of Rixq on Xevu:\n\nP(Xevu | Rixq) = P(Xevu | Rixq, Zuph) * P(Zuph | Rixq) + P(Xevu | not Rixq, Zuph) * P(Zuph | not Rixq)\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(Rixq) = 0.7\n- P(not Rixq, Xevu) = 0.06\n- P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe can calculate the probability",
