The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, we can use the observed variables to block the backdoor paths.\n\nWe can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect of Rixq on Xevu:\n\nP(Xevu | Rixq) = P(Xevu | Rixq, Zuph) * P(Zuph | Rixq) + P(Xevu | not Rixq, Zuph) * P(Zuph | not Rixq)\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(Rixq) = 0.7\n- P(not Rixq, Xevu) = 0.06\n- P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe can calculate the probability",
