The probability of male gender is 54%.\n2. For individuals who are not male (i.e., female), the probability of admission acceptance is 49%.\n3. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance as follows:\n\n- Probability of being male and accepted: 0.54 * 0.24 = 0.1296\n- Probability of being female and accepted: 0.46 * 0.49 = 0.2264\n- Overall probability of admission acceptance: 0.1296 + 0.2264 = 0.356\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability of admission rejection:\n\n- Probability of being male and rejected: 0.54 * (1 - 0.24) = 0.54 * 0.76 = 0.4104\n- Probability of being female and rejected: 0.46 * (1 - 0.49) = 0.46 * 0.51 = 0.2346\n- Overall probability of admission rejection: 0.4104 + 0.2346 = 0.6449 (approximately)\n\nSince the overall probability of admission rejection (0.6449) is greater than the overall probability of admission acceptance (0.",
