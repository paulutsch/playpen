The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of male gender is 54%.\n2. For individuals who are not male (i.e., female), the probability of admission acceptance is 49%.\n3. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance as follows:\n\n- Probability of being male and accepted: 0.54 * 0.24 = 0.1296\n- Probability of being female and accepted: 0.46 * 0.49 = 0.2264\n- Overall probability of admission acceptance: 0.1296 + 0.2264 = 0.356\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability of admission rejection:\n\n- Probability of being male and rejected: 0.54 * (1 - 0.24) = 0.54 * 0.76 = 0.4104\n- Probability of being female and rejected: 0.46 * (1 - 0.49) = 0.46 * 0.51 = 0.2346\n- Overall probability of admission rejection: 0.4104 + 0.2346 = 0.6449 (approximately)\n\nSince the overall probability of admission rejection (0.6449) is greater than the overall probability of admission acceptance (0.",
