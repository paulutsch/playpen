We are given the following information:\n\n1. P(rixq) = 0.4\n2. P(¬rixq ∧ xevu) = 0.09\n3. P(rixq ∧ xevu) = 0.22\n\nWe want to determine if the chance of xevu is smaller when observing rixq, i.e., P(xevu | rixq) ≤ P(xevu).\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(xevu | rixq):\n\nP(xevu | rixq) = P(xevu ∧ rixq) / P(rixq)\n= 0.22 / 0.4\n= 0.55\n\nNow, we need to compare this with P(xevu). To calculate P(xevu), we can use the law of total probability again:\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu ∧ rixq) + P(xevu ∧ ¬rixq)\n= 0",
