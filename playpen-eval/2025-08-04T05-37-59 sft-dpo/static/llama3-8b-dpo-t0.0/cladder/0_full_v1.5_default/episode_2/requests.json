The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following variables:\n\n- F: CEO's decision to fire the employee\n- M: Manager's decision to sign the termination letter\n- E: Employee's termination status (fired or not)\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(E=1|F=1, M=0) = 0.24 (CEO fires and manager doesn't sign)\n- P(E=1|F=1, M=1) = 0.60 (CEO fires and manager signs)\n- P(E=1|F=0, M=0) = 0.39 (CEO doesn't fire and manager doesn't sign)\n- P(F=1) = 0.18 (overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee)\n\nWe want to estimate the effect of M on E, controlling for F. To do this, we can use the counterfactual framework. Let's define the counterfactual outcome E(M=1) as the employee's termination status if the manager had signed the termination letter, given the CEO's decision to fire (F=1).\n\nWe can estimate the effect of M on E as follows:\n\n- P(E(M=1)=1|F=1) = P(E=1|F=1, M=",
