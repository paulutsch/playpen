The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's define the following variables:\n\n- F: CEO's decision to fire the employee\n- M: Manager's decision to sign the termination letter\n- E: Employee's termination status (fired or not)\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(E=1|F=1, M=0) = 0.24 (CEO fires and manager doesn't sign)\n- P(E=1|F=1, M=1) = 0.60 (CEO fires and manager signs)\n- P(E=1|F=0, M=0) = 0.39 (CEO doesn't fire and manager doesn't sign)\n- P(F=1) = 0.18 (overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee)\n\nWe want to estimate the effect of M on E, controlling for F. To do this, we can use the counterfactual framework. Let's define the counterfactual outcome E(M=1) as the employee's termination status if the manager had signed the termination letter, given the CEO's decision to fire (F=1).\n\nWe can estimate the effect of M on E as follows:\n\n- P(E(M=1)=1|F=1) = P(E=1|F=1, M=",
