This is given as 92%. \n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of kwoz given that the individual is not kwox. This is given as 47%.\n\nWe also know the overall probability of kwox, which is 1%. \n\nTo calculate the overall probability of kwoz, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(kwoz) = P(kwox) * P(kwoz|kwox) + P(not kwox) * P(kwoz|not kwox)\n\nSince the probability of kwox is 1%, the probability of not kwox is 99% (1 - 0.01).\n\nP(kwoz) = 0.01 * 0.92 + 0.99 * 0.47\nP(kwoz) = 0.0092 + 0.4653\nP(kwoz) = 0.4745\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of not kwoz:\n\nP(not kwoz) = 1 - P(kwoz)\nP(not kwoz) = 1 - 0.",
