Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%.

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The probability of alarm set by husband is 8%.\n2. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%.\n3. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%.\n\nWe want to compare the overall probability of a ringing alarm to a silent alarm. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes for each husband.\n\nLet's define two potential outcomes for each husband:\n\n- A: Alarm is set\n- ~A: Alarm is not set\n\nFor each outcome, we can calculate the probability of a ringing alarm:\n\n- P(Ringing|~A) = 75% (given in the problem statement)\n- P(Ringing|A) = 16% (given in the problem statement)\n\nWe also know that the probability of an alarm being set is 8%, so the probability of an alarm not being set is 92% (1 - 0.08).\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall probability of a ringing alarm by considering both potential outcomes:\n\nP(Ringing) = P(Ringing|~A) \\* P(~A) + P(Ringing|A) \\* P(A)\n= 0.75 \\* 0",
