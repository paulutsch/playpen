There's this guy who's been following me everywhere I go. I first noticed him at the mall last week he was just standing there staring at me. I tried to ignore him but he kept showing up. Today I saw him on my way home from school he was walking behind me. I quickened my pace but he kept up. I'm starting to feel really anxious and I don't know what to do. I've told my parents but they just think I'm being paranoid. I wish I could feel safe again.<|eot_id|>",
