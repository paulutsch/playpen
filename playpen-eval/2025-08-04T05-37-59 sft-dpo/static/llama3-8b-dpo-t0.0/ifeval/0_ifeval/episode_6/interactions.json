I'll then write a journal entry from Alex's perspective, reflecting on their stress and strategies for managing it. Here's an example:\n\n\"Today, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of deadlines and exams. I realized that I've been putting off studying for my psychology exam, and it's causing me a lot of anxiety. To manage my stress, I'm going to start breaking down my study sessions into smaller chunks, and I'll also make time for exercise and meditation each day. I'm also going to talk to my friends about how I'm feeling, and we can study together. By taking control of my schedule and prioritizing self-care, I'm hoping to feel more calm and focused.\"\n\nThis example is based on a common stress scenario, and it shows Alex taking steps to address their stress and develop a plan for managing it.",
