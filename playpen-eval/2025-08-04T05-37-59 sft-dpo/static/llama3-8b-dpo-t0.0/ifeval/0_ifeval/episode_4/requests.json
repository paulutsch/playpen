When a vehicle's axle is overloaded, it can cause more stress and pressure on the road surface, leading to increased damage. This damage can manifest as potholes, cracks, and uneven wear on the road, which can be costly to repair and maintain. As a result, increased axle weight can have a significant impact on road infrastructure and safety.<|eot_id|>",
