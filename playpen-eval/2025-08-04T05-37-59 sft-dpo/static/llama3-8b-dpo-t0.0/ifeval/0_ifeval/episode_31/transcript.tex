	 "Dear [Friend's Name],\\ \tt \\ \tt I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. As you know, we've been friends for a long time, and I value our relationship deeply. However, there are a few things that can trigger me and make me feel upset or defensive.\\ \tt \\ \tt Firstly, I'm extremely sensitive to criticism, especially when it's not constructive. If you have something to say, please make sure it's said in a kind and respectful manner. I'm always open to feedback and willing to learn, but harsh words can really hurt my feelings.\\ \tt \\ \tt Secondly, I get anxious when plans change at the last minute. I like to plan ahead and make sure I'm prepared, so when things get cancelled or rescheduled, it can be really stressful for me. If you need to make changes, please give me as much notice as possible so I can adjust my schedule accordingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Lastly, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I can get really frustrated when things don't go according to plan. If you notice me getting worked up, please try to calm me down and remind me that it's okay to make mistakes.\\ \tt \\ \tt I know these are just a few things that can trigger me, and I'm not expecting you to remember them all the time. However, I wanted to share them with you so we can work together to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Thanks for being such a great friend, and I look forward to catching up with you soon.\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]"\\ \tt \\ \tt "
