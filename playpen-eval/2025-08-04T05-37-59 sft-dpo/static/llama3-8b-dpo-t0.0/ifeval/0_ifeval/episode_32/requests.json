It's a more colloquial and friendly way to express the idea that Werner wasn't the most clever or insightful person.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use:\n\nWerner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht sehr clever.\n\nThis translation uses the word \"clever\", which is a more informal and conversational way to express the idea that Werner wasn't the most intelligent or perceptive person.\n\nIn general, the original sentence is a bit blunt and might come across as slightly critical or dismissive. If you want to express a similar idea in a more friendly and supportive way, you could rephrase the sentence to focus on Werner's positive qualities and then mention his limitations in a more gentle way. For example:\n\nWerner war ein guter Freund von mir, und obwohl er nicht immer die cleversten Ideen hatte, war er immer sehr hilfsbereit und loyal.\n\nThis revised sentence focuses on Werner's positive qualities and then mentions his limitations in a more gentle and supportive way.<|eot_id|>",
