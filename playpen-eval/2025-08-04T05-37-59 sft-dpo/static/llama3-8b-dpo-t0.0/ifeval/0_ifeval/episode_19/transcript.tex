	 Congratulations on your new furry family member.  Training a puppy requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Here are a few options to consider:\\ \tt \\ \tt **Option 1: Positive Reinforcement Training**\\ \tt This method focuses on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. It's a gentle and effective approach that helps build trust and strengthens the bond between you and your puppy. You can use clicker training or simply offer treats when your puppy performs a desired action.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Option 2: Clicker Training**\\ \tt Clicker training is a type of positive reinforcement training that uses a small device that makes a distinct sound (a "click") to mark the exact moment your puppy performs a desired action. This helps your puppy associate the sound with the behavior and learn faster.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Option 3: Crate Training**\\ \tt Crate training involves confining your puppy to a crate when you're not supervising them. This helps with housetraining, reduces separation anxiety, and prevents destructive behavior. However, it's essential to introduce the crate gradually and make it a comfortable, safe space for your puppy.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Option 4: Puppy Classes**\\ \tt Enrolling your puppy in a puppy class can be an excellent way to socialize them with other dogs, people, and new environments. These classes often cover basic obedience training, such as sit, stay, and walking on a leash.\\ \tt \\ \tt Which one you choose?
