        <p>**Creating a Parenting Plan: Understanding Your Daily Schedule**<br/><br/>When parents decide to co-parent, it&#x27;s essential to establish a parenting plan that works for everyone involved. This plan outlines how you will share responsibilities, make decisions, and communicate with each other about your child&#x27;s care. You may have to meet with a helper, such as a mediator or counselor, to work out the details of your parenting plan. The first step in this process is to estimate how many hours you have each day for parenting and whether that&#x27;s enough to meet your child&#x27;s needs.<br/><br/>**Assessing Your Daily Schedule**<br/><br/>To create a realistic parenting plan, you need to understand your daily schedule.
