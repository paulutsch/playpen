More than you might think.\nBrandon: I'm well aware, Cecilia. It's a critic's job to wield them.\nCecilia: But do you understand the weight of them? The lives they can shatter?\nBrandon: Art is not for the faint-hearted. If you can't handle the critique, you're in the wrong industry.\nCecilia: It's not about handling criticism, Brandon. It's about understanding the soul of the art. You dissect it like a cold, lifeless body on an autopsy table.\nBrandon: And you, Cecilia, romanticize it to the point of delusion. Art is not some sacred, untouchable entity. It's a commodity, like everything else.\nCecilia: That's where you're wrong. Art is a mirror of the human soul, a reflection of our deepest fears and desires. It's not a product to be bought and sold.\nBrandon: And yet, you sell your installations, don't you? How is that different?\nCecilia: I sell my work to survive, not to profit.
