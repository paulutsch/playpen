Never thought I'd see you at a festival again.\nJules: Well, Hartman, not all of us can be washed-up rockstars clinging to past glory.\nRichie: Ouch. That's a bit harsh, don't you think?\nJules: You always did have a knack for understatement.\nRichie: And you always had a knack for being a buzzkill. \nJules: I was the only one who ever took the music seriously, Richie. You were too busy playing the rockstar.\nRichie: And you were too busy playing the martyr. \nJules: I was trying to create something meaningful. You just wanted the fame.\nRichie: And you just wanted to control everything. That's why you left, isn't it?\nJules: I left because you wouldnâ€™t listen. You never did.\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Richie would feel...\nShocked\nDefensive\nProud\nRegretful\n\nGive each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\n\nYou must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\n\nShocked: <score>\nDefensive: <score>\nProud: <score>\nRegretful: <score>\n\n\n[End of answer]\n\nRemember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\n\nYour answer:\n",
