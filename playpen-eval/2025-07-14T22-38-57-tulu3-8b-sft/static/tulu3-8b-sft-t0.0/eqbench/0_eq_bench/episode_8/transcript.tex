I trust you've done the reading?"\\ \tt Jen: "Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world, Dr. Hall. And yes, I've done the reading. Twice."\\ \tt Dr. Hall: "Twice? My, my. Overachieving or overcompensating, I wonder?"\\ \tt Jen: "Funny you should mention overcompensation, Dr. Hall."\\ \tt Dr. Hall: "Careful, Ms. Vasquez. Your wit is as sharp as a butter knife."\\ \tt Jen: "And your condescension is as subtle as a sledgehammer, Dr. Hall."\\ \tt Dr. Hall: "I see. You're here to debate, not to learn."\\ \tt Jen: "I'm here to do both. Can't say the same for everyone, though."\\ \tt Dr. Hall: "Enough. This is not a courtroom, Ms. Vasquez. It's a classroom."\\ \tt [End dialogue]\\ \tt \\ \tt At the end of this dialogue, Jen would feel...\\ \tt Reprimanded\\ \tt Dismissive\\ \tt Frustrated\\ \tt Defiant\\ \tt \\ \tt Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\\ \tt \\ \tt You must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\\ \tt \\ \tt Reprimanded: <score>\\ \tt Dismissive: <score>\\ \tt Frustrated: <score>\\ \tt Defiant: <score>\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt [End of answer]\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer:\\ \tt
