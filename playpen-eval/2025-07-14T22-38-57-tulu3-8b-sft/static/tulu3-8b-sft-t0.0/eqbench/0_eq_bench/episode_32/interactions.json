Never thought I'd see you at a festival again.\nJules: Well, Hartman, not all of us can be washed-up rockstars clinging to past glory.\nRichie: Ouch. That's a bit harsh, don't you think?\nJules: You always did have a knack for understatement.\nRichie: And you always had a knack for being a buzzkill. \nJules: I was the only one who ever took the music seriously, Richie. You were too busy playing the rockstar.\nRichie: And you were too busy playing the martyr. \nJules: I was trying to create something meaningful. You just wanted the fame.\nRichie: And you just wanted to control everything. That's why you left, isn't it?\nJules: I left because you wouldnâ€™t listen. You never did.\nRichie: And you never understood the first thing about rock 'n' roll. It's not just about the music, Jules. It's about the energy, the crowd, the chaos.\nJules: And look where that chaos got you, Richie. Alone on a stage, playing to a crowd that doesn't remember your name.\nRichie: Better than being forgotten entirely, isn't it?\nJules: I'd rather be forgotten than remembered as a sellout.\nRichie: Is that what you think I am, Jules? A sellout?\nJules: You tell me, Richie. What else do you call someone who traded their passion for popularity?\nRichie: And what do you call someone who abandoned their friends for their ego?\nJules: At least I didn't abandon my principles.\nRichie: And look where your principles got you. Alone in a studio, making music no one hears.\nJules: Better than making noise no one wants to hear, Richie.\n[End dialogue]\n\nAt the end of this dialogue, Jules would feel...\nTriumphant\nExhausted\nRemorseful\nDefensive\n\nGive each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\n\nYou must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\n\nTriumphant: <score>\nExhausted: <score>\nRemorseful: <score>\nDefensive: <score>\n\n\n[End of answer]\n\nRemember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\n\nYour answer:\n",
