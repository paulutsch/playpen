That's a serious claim. \nJulian: And I stand by it. \nBennett: You're ignoring centuries of scientific evidence, Julian. \nJulian: I'm not ignoring it, Bennett. I'm questioning it. \nBennett: There's a difference between questioning and rejecting outright. \nJulian: And there's a difference between accepting and blindly following. \nBennett: I've seen the Earth with my own eyes, Julian.
