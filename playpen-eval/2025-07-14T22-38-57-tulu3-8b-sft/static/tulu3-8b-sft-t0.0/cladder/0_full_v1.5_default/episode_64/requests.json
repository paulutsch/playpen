Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 15%. For those who are not zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 50%. For those who are zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 32%. For those who are zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 85%. The overall probability of zuph is 84%. Will rixq increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

This is because the probability of xevu is higher when zuph is present, regardless of whether rixq is present or not. Specifically, the probability of xevu is 32% when zuph is present and rixq is not, and 85% when zuph is present and rixq is. Therefore, the presence of rixq does not have a significant effect on the probability of xevu, as the presence of zuph already increases the probability of xevu to a much higher degree.<|end_of_text|>",
