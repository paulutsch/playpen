The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 55%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
