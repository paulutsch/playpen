	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 67%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 55%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, it would be less likely to see college admission for smokers if they had been nonsmokers. This is because smoking has a direct negative effect on college admission, and the probability of college admission is lower for smokers (55%) compared to nonsmokers (67%). Therefore, if a smoker had not smoked, their probability of college admission would increase to the nonsmoker rate of 67%.<|end_of_text|>
