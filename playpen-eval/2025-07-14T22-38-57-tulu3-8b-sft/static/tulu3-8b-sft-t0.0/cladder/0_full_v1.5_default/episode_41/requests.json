Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%.

This is because the probability of having a college degree or higher and black hair (3%) is actually higher than the probability of having black hair given a high school degree or lower (25%). This suggests that there is a positive association between having a college degree or higher and having black hair, rather than a negative one.<|end_of_text|>",
