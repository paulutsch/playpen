	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. We know that intelligent parents and confounder active causes high parental social status. intelligent parents and confounder active and high parental social status causes intelligent child. We observed confounder active. Would the child is intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, the child would be intelligent if intelligent parents instead of unintelligent parents. This is because intelligent parents have a direct effect on the child's intelligence, and they also cause high parental social status, which in turn has a direct effect on the child's intelligence. The confounder, which is observed, is active and causes high parental social status when intelligent parents are present. Therefore, the presence of intelligent parents would likely result in an intelligent child.<|end_of_text|>
