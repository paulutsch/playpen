This is because intelligent parents have a direct effect on the child's intelligence, and they also cause high parental social status, which in turn has a direct effect on the child's intelligence. The confounder, which is observed, is active and causes high parental social status when intelligent parents are present. Therefore, the presence of intelligent parents would likely result in an intelligent child.<|end_of_text|>",
