Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%.

Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of xevu is not smaller when observing rixq. This is because the probability of rixq and xevu (10%) is higher than the probability of not rixq and xevu (6%). Therefore, observing rixq increases the likelihood of also observing xevu.<|end_of_text|>",
