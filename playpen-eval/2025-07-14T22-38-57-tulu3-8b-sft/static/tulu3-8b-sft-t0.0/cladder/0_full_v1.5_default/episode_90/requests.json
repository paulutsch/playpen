Hwax has a direct effect on rukz. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 9%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 18%. For those who are pexu, would it be less likely to see rukz if the individual was not pexu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

The probability of rukz is 9% for those who are not pexu, and 18% for those who are pexu. Therefore, being pexu increases the likelihood of rukz, not decreases it.<|end_of_text|>",
