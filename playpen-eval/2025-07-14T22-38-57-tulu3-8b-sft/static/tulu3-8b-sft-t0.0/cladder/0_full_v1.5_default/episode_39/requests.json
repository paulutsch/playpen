Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.

Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, large feet are not more likely than small feet overall. This is because the probability of large feet for people who went to tanning salons is 70%, but only 10% of the population went to tanning salons. For the remaining 90% of the population, the probability of large feet is 13%. Therefore, the overall probability of large feet is a weighted average of these two probabilities, which is less than 70%.<|end_of_text|>",
