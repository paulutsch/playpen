	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, large feet are not more likely than small feet overall. This is because the probability of large feet for people who went to tanning salons is 70%, but only 10% of the population went to tanning salons. For the remaining 90% of the population, the probability of large feet is 13%. Therefore, the overall probability of large feet is a weighted average of these two probabilities, which is less than 70%.<|end_of_text|>
