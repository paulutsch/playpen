The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Method 1: We look directly at how drinking coffee correlates with broken bones in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to hospitalization status. To understand how drinking coffee affects broken bones, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Both methods provide different perspectives on the relationship between drinking coffee and broken bones, but neither method alone can fully capture the causal relationship. Method 1 looks at the correlation between drinking coffee and broken bones in general, which may not account for the effect of hospitalization status on this relationship. On the other hand, Method 2 looks at the correlation case by case according to hospitalization status, which may not account for the direct effect of drinking coffee on broken bones. To understand the causal relationship, it is necessary to consider both methods and their interactions, rather than choosing one over the other.<|end_of_text|>",
