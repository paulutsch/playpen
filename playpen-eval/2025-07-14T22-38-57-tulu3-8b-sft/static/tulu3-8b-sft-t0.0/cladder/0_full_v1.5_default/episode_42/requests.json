Department competitiveness has a direct effect on peanut allergy. For individuals who are not male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 48%. For individuals who are male, the probability of being allergic to peanuts is 36%. For individuals who are male, would it be more likely to see being allergic to peanuts if the individual had not been male?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

The probability of being allergic to peanuts is 36% for males and 48% for females. Therefore, being male actually decreases the probability of being allergic to peanuts, not increases it.<|end_of_text|>",
