	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall. This is because the probability of admission acceptance for non-male individuals is 49%, and the probability of admission acceptance for male individuals is 24%. However, the overall probability of male gender is 54%. Therefore, the overall probability of admission acceptance can be calculated as follows: (54% * 24%) + (46% * 49%) = 11.76% + 22.54% = 34.3%. Since 34.3% is greater than 50%, admission acceptance is more likely than admission rejection overall.<|end_of_text|>
