Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall. This is because the probability of admission acceptance for non-male individuals is 49%, and the probability of admission acceptance for male individuals is 24%. However, the overall probability of male gender is 54%. Therefore, the overall probability of admission acceptance can be calculated as follows: (54% * 24%) + (46% * 49%) = 11.76% + 22.54% = 34.3%. Since 34.3% is greater than 50%, admission acceptance is more likely than admission rejection overall.<|end_of_text|>",
