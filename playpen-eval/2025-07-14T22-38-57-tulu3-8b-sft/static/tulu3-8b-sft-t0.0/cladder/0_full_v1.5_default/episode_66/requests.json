Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%.

Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of xevu is not larger when observing rixq. This is because the probability of rixq and xevu (10%) is less than the sum of the probability of rixq (70%) and the probability of not rixq and xevu (6%) (which is 76%). This indicates that the presence of rixq does not increase the likelihood of xevu, and in fact, the presence of rixq and xevu is less likely than the sum of the individual probabilities of rixq and xevu.<|end_of_text|>",
