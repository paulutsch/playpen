For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%. Is gyzp more likely than not gyzp overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nYes, gyzp is more likely than not gyzp overall. This is because the overall probability of gyzp is the weighted average of the probability of gyzp for those who are xevo and those who are not xevo. Given that the probability of gyzp for those who are xevo is 78% and for those who are not xevo is 39%, and the overall probability of xevo is 48%, the overall probability of gyzp can be calculated as follows:\n\nOverall probability of gyzp = (Probability of gyzp for xevo * Probability of xevo) + (Probability of gyzp for not xevo * Probability of not xevo)\nOverall probability of gyzp = (0.78 * 0.48) + (0.39 * 0.52)\nOverall probability of gyzp = 0.3744 + 0.2028\nOverall probability of gyzp = 0.5772\n\nSince 0.5772 is greater than 0.5, gyzp is more likely than not gyzp overall.<|end_of_text|>",
