	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijw and tijv. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. The overall probability of xevo is 48%. For those who are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 39%. For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%. Is gyzp more likely than not gyzp overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, gyzp is more likely than not gyzp overall. This is because the overall probability of gyzp is the weighted average of the probability of gyzp for those who are xevo and those who are not xevo. Given that the probability of gyzp for those who are xevo is 78% and for those who are not xevo is 39%, and the overall probability of xevo is 48%, the overall probability of gyzp can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt Overall probability of gyzp = (Probability of gyzp for xevo * Probability of xevo) + (Probability of gyzp for not xevo * Probability of not xevo)\\ \tt Overall probability of gyzp = (0.78 * 0.48) + (0.39 * 0.52)\\ \tt Overall probability of gyzp = 0.3744 + 0.2028\\ \tt Overall probability of gyzp = 0.5772\\ \tt \\ \tt Since 0.5772 is greater than 0.5, gyzp is more likely than not gyzp overall.<|end_of_text|>
