Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%.

The observed probabilities suggest that living close to a college increases the probability of having a college degree or higher, but it does not necessarily translate to a higher probability of a high salary. This is because the relationship between education level and salary is confounded by unobserved confounders, which have a direct effect on both education level and salary. Therefore, the observed association between education level and salary may not be causal.<|end_of_text|>",
