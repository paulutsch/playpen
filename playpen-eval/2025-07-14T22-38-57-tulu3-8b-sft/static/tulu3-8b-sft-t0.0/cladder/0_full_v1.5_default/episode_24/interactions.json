The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The observed probabilities suggest that living close to a college increases the probability of having a college degree or higher, but it does not necessarily translate to a higher probability of a high salary. This is because the relationship between education level and salary is confounded by unobserved confounders, which have a direct effect on both education level and salary. Therefore, the observed association between education level and salary may not be causal.<|end_of_text|>",
