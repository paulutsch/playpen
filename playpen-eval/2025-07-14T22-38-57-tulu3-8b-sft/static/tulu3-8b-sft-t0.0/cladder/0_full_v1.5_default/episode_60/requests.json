Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%.

This is because the observed correlation between a college degree and large feet could be due to a common cause, such as unobserved confounders that affect both education level and foot size. In this case, the observed correlation does not imply causation, and the chance of large feet is not necessarily smaller when observing a college degree or higher.<|end_of_text|>",
