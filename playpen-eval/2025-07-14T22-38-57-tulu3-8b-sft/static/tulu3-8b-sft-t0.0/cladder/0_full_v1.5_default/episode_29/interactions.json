Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the probability of scurvy is higher (73%) for patients not consuming citrus compared to those consuming citrus (54%). This indicates that consuming citrus, which is rich in vitamin C, reduces the probability of scurvy. Therefore, vitamin C, which is found in citrus, plays a crucial role in preventing scurvy.<|end_of_text|>",
