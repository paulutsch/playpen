Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nYes, eating citrus positively affects scurvy through vitamin C. This is because the probability of scurvy is higher (73%) for patients not consuming citrus compared to those consuming citrus (54%). This indicates that consuming citrus, which is rich in vitamin C, reduces the probability of scurvy. Therefore, vitamin C, which is found in citrus, plays a crucial role in preventing scurvy.<|end_of_text|>",
