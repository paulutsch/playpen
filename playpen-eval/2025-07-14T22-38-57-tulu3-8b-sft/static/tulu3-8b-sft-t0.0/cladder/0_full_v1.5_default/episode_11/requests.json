The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Obesity has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For normal weight people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 91%. For normal weight people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 71%. For obese people and without diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 69%. For obese people and with diabetes, the probability of long lifespan is 43%. For normal weight people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 28%. For normal weight people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 20%. For obese people and nonsmokers, the probability of having diabetes is 57%. For obese people and smokers, the probability of having diabetes is 70%. The overall probability of smoker is 8%. If we disregard the mediation effect through diabetes, would obesity negatively affect lifespan?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

This conclusion is based on the given probabilities and the direct effect of obesity on lifespan. For obese people without diabetes, the probability of a long lifespan is 69%, which is lower than the probability for normal weight people without diabetes, which is 91%. This indicates that obesity, on its own, has a negative effect on lifespan, even when disregarding the mediation effect through diabetes.<|end_of_text|>",
