Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%.

The probability of lung cancer is already given as 61% for people who do not listen to jazz, and 79% for people who listen to jazz. Therefore, if a person who listens to jazz stops listening to jazz, their probability of lung cancer would not decrease below the 61% baseline for non-jazz listeners.<|end_of_text|>",
