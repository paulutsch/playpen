The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on wibl. Uvzi has a direct effect on wibl. Method 1: We look directly at how zuph correlates with uvzi in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to wibl. To understand how zuph affects uvzi, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Method 1 may be more appropriate when we are interested in understanding the general relationship between Zuph and Uvzi, while Method 2 may be more appropriate when we are interested in understanding how Zuph affects Uvzi in specific cases according to Wibl.
