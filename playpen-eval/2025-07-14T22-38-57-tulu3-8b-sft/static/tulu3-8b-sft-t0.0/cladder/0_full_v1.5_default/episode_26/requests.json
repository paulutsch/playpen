Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall. This is because the probability of admission acceptance for individuals who are not male is 61%, and for individuals who are male, it is 65%. Since the overall probability of male gender is 13%, the weighted average of the probabilities of admission acceptance for males and non-males will be higher than the probability of admission rejection. Therefore, admission acceptance is more likely than admission rejection overall.<|end_of_text|>",
