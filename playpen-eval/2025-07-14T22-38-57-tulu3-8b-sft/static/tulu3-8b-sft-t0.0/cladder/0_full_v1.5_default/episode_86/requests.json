Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of lirg is not smaller when observing jyka. This can be determined by calculating the conditional probability of lirg given jyka. \n\nP(lirg | jyka) = P(jyka and lirg) / P(jyka) = 12% / 14% = 85.71%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the unconditional probability of lirg:\n\nP(lirg) = P(jyka and lirg) + P(not jyka and lirg) = 12% + (1 - 72%) * P(lirg | not jyka) = 12% + 28% * P(lirg | not jyka).\n\nWe don't know P(lirg | not jyka), but we can find it by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(lirg) = P(jyka and lirg) + P(not jyka and lirg) = 12% + 28% * P(lirg | not jyka).\n\nSince we know P(lirg | not jyka) = 72% / (1 - 14%) = 72% / 86% = 83.72%, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nP(lirg) = 12% + 28% * 83.72% = 12% + 23",
