The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look at how education level correlates with salary case by case according to skill. Method 2: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Both methods provide different perspectives on the relationship between education level and salary, but neither is inherently more correct than the other. Method 1 considers the mediating effect of skill on the relationship between education level and salary, which can provide a more nuanced understanding of the causal relationship. However, Method 2 provides a more direct and generalizable view of the relationship between education level and salary. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific research question and the context of the study.<|end_of_text|>",
