Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 78%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 32%.

The probability of the alarm ringing is 78% when the husband does not set the alarm, and 32% when the husband does set the alarm. Therefore, the presence of the husband setting the alarm does not decrease the likelihood of the alarm ringing, but rather increases it.<|end_of_text|>",
