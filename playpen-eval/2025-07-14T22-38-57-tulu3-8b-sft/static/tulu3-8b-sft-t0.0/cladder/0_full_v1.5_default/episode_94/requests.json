Even though we know that xevo or tijv causes gyzp, we do not know the specific causal relationship between xevo and gyzp. It is possible that gyzp is caused by a combination of xevo and tijv, or that gyzp is only caused by tijv. Without additional information, we cannot definitively say that an individual would be gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo.<|end_of_text|>",
