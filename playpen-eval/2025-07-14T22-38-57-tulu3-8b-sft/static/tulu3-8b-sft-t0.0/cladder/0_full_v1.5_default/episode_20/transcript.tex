	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of wet ground is not larger when observing a rainy season. This is because the probability of a rainy season and wet ground (50%) is less than the probability of a dry season and wet ground (7%). This suggests that wet ground is more likely to occur during a dry season than a rainy season, despite the rainy season having a higher overall probability.<|end_of_text|>
