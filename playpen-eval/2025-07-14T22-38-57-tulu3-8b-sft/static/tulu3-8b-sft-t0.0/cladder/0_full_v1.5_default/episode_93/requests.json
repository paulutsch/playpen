Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp.

This is because tijw could still cause tijv and gyzp, even if xevo is not present. Additionally, tijv could still cause gyzp, even if xevo is not present. Therefore, the absence of xevo does not guarantee that an individual is not gyzp.<|end_of_text|>",
