The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. Method 1: We look directly at how the man in the room correlates with room in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to the candle. To understand how the man in the room affects room, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Method 2, on the other hand, considers the correlation case by case according to the candle, which may provide a more detailed understanding of the causal relationship.
