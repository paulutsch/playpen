Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%.

This can be seen by comparing the probabilities of xevu for those who are not gwet and are yomx (63%) to those who are not gwet and are not yomx (82%). Since 63% is less than 82%, yomx does not increase the chance of xevu.<|end_of_text|>",
