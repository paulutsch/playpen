Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 17%. The probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing alarm is 69%. The probability of alarm set by husband and ringing alarm is 3%.

The overall probability of the alarm ringing is the sum of the probability of the alarm being set by the husband and ringing (3%) and the probability of the alarm not being set by the husband and ringing (69%). \n\nThe overall probability of the alarm ringing is 3% + 69% = 72%. \n\nWhen we observe that the alarm was set by the husband, the probability of the alarm ringing is 3%. \n\nSo, the chance of the alarm ringing is smaller when we observe that the alarm was set by the husband.<|end_of_text|>",
