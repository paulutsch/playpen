This is because the probability of gyzp is already higher for those who are not tijv and are xevo (14%) compared to those who are not tijv and are not xevo (29%). Additionally, the probability of gyzp is lower for those who are tijv and are xevo (16%) compared to those who are tijv and are not xevo (11%). Therefore, the presence of xevo does not increase the chance of gyzp.<|end_of_text|>",
