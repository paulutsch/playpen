The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We can do this by considering the two scenarios: when the manager signs the termination letter and when the manager does not sign the termination letter.\n\nThe probability of the employee being fired when the manager signs the termination letter is 42%. The probability of the manager signing the termination letter is 35%. Therefore, the overall probability of the employee being fired when the manager signs the termination letter is 42% * 35% = 14.7%.\n\nThe probability of the employee being fired when the manager does not sign the termination letter is 76%. The probability of the manager not signing the termination letter is 100% - 35% = 65%. Therefore, the overall probability of the employee being fired when the manager does not sign the termination letter is 76% * 65% = 49.4%.\n\nThe overall probability of the employee being fired is the sum of the two probabilities: 14.7% + 49.4% = 64.1%. Therefore, the employee is more likely to be fired overall.<|end_of_text|>",
