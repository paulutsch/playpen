The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on lirg. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%. Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We can do this by considering the probability of lirg for those who are jyka and those who are not jyka, and then weighting these probabilities by the overall probability of being jyka.\n\nThe overall probability of lirg can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(lirg) = P(lirg|jyka) * P(jyka) + P(lirg|not jyka) * P(not jyka)\n\nP(lirg) = 0.66 * 0.14 + 0.71 * 0.86\n\nP(lirg) = 0.0924 + 0.6106\n\nP(lirg) = 0.703\n\nSince 0.703 is greater than 0.5, lirg is more likely than not lirg overall.<|end_of_text|>",
