Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, lirg is not less likely than not lirg overall. To determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of lirg. We can do this by considering the probability of lirg for those who are jyka and those who are not jyka, and then weighting these probabilities by the overall probability of being jyka.\n\nThe overall probability of lirg can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(lirg) = P(lirg|jyka) * P(jyka) + P(lirg|not jyka) * P(not jyka)\n\nP(lirg) = 0.66 * 0.14 + 0.71 * 0.86\n\nP(lirg) = 0.0924 + 0.6106\n\nP(lirg) = 0.703\n\nSince 0.703 is greater than 0.5, lirg is more likely than not lirg overall.<|end_of_text|>",
