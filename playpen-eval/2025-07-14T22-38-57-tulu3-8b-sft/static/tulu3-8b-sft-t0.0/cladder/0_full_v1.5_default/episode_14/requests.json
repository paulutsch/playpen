Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%.

Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, lung cancer is not more likely than the absence of lung cancer overall. This is because the probability of lung cancer for nonsmokers is 58%, and for smokers, it is 61%. However, the overall probability of smoking is 12%, meaning that 88% of the population does not smoke. Therefore, the overall probability of lung cancer is 58% (probability of lung cancer for nonsmokers) + (12% * 61% probability of lung cancer for smokers) = 58% + 7.32% = 65.32%. The probability of absence of lung cancer is 100% - 65.32% = 34.68%.<|end_of_text|>",
