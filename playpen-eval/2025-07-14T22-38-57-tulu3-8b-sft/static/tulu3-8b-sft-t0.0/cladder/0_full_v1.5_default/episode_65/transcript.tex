	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Swoy has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. For those who are not rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 46%. For those who are not rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 41%. For those who are rixq and are not zuph, the probability of xevu is 66%. For those who are rixq and are zuph, the probability of xevu is 60%. For those who are not rixq, the probability of zuph is 61%. For those who are rixq, the probability of zuph is 34%. For those who are rixq, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not rixq?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not rixq. This is because the probability of xevu is higher for those who are rixq, regardless of whether they are also zuph. Specifically, the probability of xevu is 66% for those who are rixq and not zuph, and 60% for those who are rixq and zuph. In contrast, the probability of xevu is only 46% for those who are not rixq and not zuph, and 41% for those who are not rixq and zuph. Therefore, being rixq increases the likelihood of xevu, regardless of the individual's zuph status.<|end_of_text|>
