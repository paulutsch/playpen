The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of high rainfall is not smaller when observing waking up late. To determine this, we can use the law of total probability. Let's define the following events:\n\n- A: Alice wakes up on time\n- B: Alice wakes up late\n- C: High rainfall\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(A) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91 (probability of waking up on time)\n- P(C|A) = 0.53 (probability of high rainfall given waking up on time)\n- P(C|B) = 0.08 (probability of high rainfall given waking up late)\n\nWe want to find P(C), the overall probability of high rainfall. Using the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(C) = P(C|A)P(A) + P(C|B)P(B)\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\nP(C) = (0.53 * 0.91) + (0.08 * 0.09)\nP(C) = 0.4833 + 0.0072\nP(C) = 0.4905\n\nSo, the overall probability of high rainfall is 0.4905, which is not smaller when observing waking up late.<|end_of_text|>",
