The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. The overall probability of jyka is 25%. The probability of not jyka and kwox is 71%. The probability of jyka and kwox is 24%.
