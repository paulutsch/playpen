The probability of black hair is 66% for people not using tanning salon treatments, and 24% for people who went to tanning salons. However, since 99% of people use tanning salon treatments, the overall probability of black hair is closer to the 24% for people who went to tanning salons. Therefore, black hair is less likely than blond hair overall.<|end_of_text|>",
