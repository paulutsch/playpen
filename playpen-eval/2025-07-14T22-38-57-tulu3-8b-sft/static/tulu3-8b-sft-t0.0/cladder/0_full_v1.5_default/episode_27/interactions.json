The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

While intelligent parents have a direct effect on their child's intelligence, there are also other unobserved factors that have a direct effect on both parents' social status and child's intelligence. Additionally, parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence.\n\nGiven the probabilities provided, we can see that the probability of an intelligent child given intelligent parents is 4% (0.04), while the probability of an intelligent child given unintelligent parents is 54% (0.54). This suggests that the presence of intelligent parents does not necessarily guarantee an intelligent child, and in fact, the probability of an intelligent child is higher when the parents are unintelligent.\n\nTherefore, the chance of an intelligent child is not smaller when observing intelligent parents, and in fact, it is higher when observing unintelligent parents.<|end_of_text|>",
