Penguin mood has a direct effect on curly hair. For those who choose to take the stairs, the probability of curly hair is 70%. For those who choose to take the elevator, the probability of curly hair is 17%. For those who choose to take the elevator, would it be less likely to see curly hair if I had taken the stairs?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
