	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Lip thickness has a direct effect on fame. Method 1: We look at how appearance correlates with lip thickness case by case according to fame. Method 2: We look directly at how appearance correlates with lip thickness in general. To understand how appearance affects lip thickness, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it is not more correct to use Method 1 than Method 2 to understand how appearance affects lip thickness. Both methods can provide insights into the relationship between appearance and lip thickness, but they do so in different ways. Method 1 involves looking at the correlation between appearance and lip thickness on a case-by-case basis according to fame, which may introduce confounding factors and make it difficult to isolate the direct effect of appearance on lip thickness. Method 2, on the other hand, looks directly at the correlation between appearance and lip thickness in general, which can help to identify the direct relationship between these two factors without the influence of fame or other confounding variables. Therefore, Method 2 is generally more appropriate for understanding the direct effect of appearance on lip thickness.<|end_of_text|>
