The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Maternal smoking status has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Health condition has a direct effect on infant's birth weight and freckles. Infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. Method 1: We look directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with freckles in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to infant's birth weight. To understand how maternal smoking status affects freckles, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

Additionally, infant's birth weight has a direct effect on freckles. Health condition is unobserved. \n\nMethod 1 looks directly at how maternal smoking status correlates with freckles in general, which may not account for the confounding effect of health condition. \n\nMethod 2 looks at this correlation case by case according to infant's birth weight, which may help to control for the confounding effect of health condition. \n\nTherefore, it is more correct to use Method 2 than Method 1, as it takes into account the direct effect of infant's birth weight on freckles and the unobserved health condition.<|end_of_text|>",
