	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on zuph and uvzi. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Method 1: We look at how zuph correlates with uvzi case by case according to wibl. Method 2: We look directly at how zuph correlates with uvzi in general. To understand how zuph affects uvzi, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it is not more correct to use Method 1 than Method 2. Both methods provide different perspectives on the relationship between zuph and uvzi, but neither is inherently more correct than the other. Method 1 allows for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship by considering the effect of wibl on zuph and uvzi, while Method 2 provides a more general view of the correlation between zuph and uvzi. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific research question and the context of the study.<|end_of_text|>
