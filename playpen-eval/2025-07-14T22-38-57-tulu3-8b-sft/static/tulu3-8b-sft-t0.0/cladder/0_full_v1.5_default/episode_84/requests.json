Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%. For those who are yomx, would it be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

The probability of xevu is already given as 68% for those who are not yomx, and 40% for those who are yomx. The presence of yomx does not change the probability of xevu for those who are not yomx, as the question states that yomx has a direct effect on gwet, which in turn has a direct effect on xevu. Therefore, the presence or absence of yomx does not affect the probability of xevu for those who are not yomx.<|end_of_text|>",
