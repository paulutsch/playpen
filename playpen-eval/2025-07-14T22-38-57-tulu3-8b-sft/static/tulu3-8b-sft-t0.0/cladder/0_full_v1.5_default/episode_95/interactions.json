Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes not yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox. We observed an individual is qwiu. Would an individual is kwox if jyka instead of not jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
