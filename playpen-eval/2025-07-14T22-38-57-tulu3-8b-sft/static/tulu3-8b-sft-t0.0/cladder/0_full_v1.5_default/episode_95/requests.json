Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes not yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox.

The direct effect of qwiu on jyka and the direct effect of yupt on kwox are independent of each other. Therefore, the presence of jyka does not guarantee the presence of yupt, and the presence of yupt does not guarantee the presence of kwox.<|end_of_text|>",
