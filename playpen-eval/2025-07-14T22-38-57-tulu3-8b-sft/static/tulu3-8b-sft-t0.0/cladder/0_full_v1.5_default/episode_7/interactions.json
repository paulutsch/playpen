The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 59%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 28%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 29%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 77%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The given probabilities suggest that the effect of gender on admission status is independent of department competitiveness. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 58% in non-competitive departments and 25% in competitive departments. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 59% in non-competitive departments and 28% in competitive departments. The difference in admission probabilities between non-competitive and competitive departments is greater for individuals who are not male (58% vs. 25%) than for individuals who are male (59% vs. 28%). This indicates that department competitiveness has a more significant impact on admission status for individuals who are not male, suggesting that gender does not positively affect admission status through department competitiveness.<|end_of_text|>",
