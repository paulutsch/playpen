Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%.

Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, ringing alarm is not more likely than silent alarm overall. This is because the probability of the alarm ringing when the husband does not set it (75%) is higher than the probability of the alarm ringing when the husband sets it (16%). Therefore, the overall probability of the alarm ringing is lower than the overall probability of the alarm being silent.<|end_of_text|>",
