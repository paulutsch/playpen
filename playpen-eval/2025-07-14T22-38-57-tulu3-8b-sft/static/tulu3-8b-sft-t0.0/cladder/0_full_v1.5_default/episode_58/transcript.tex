	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Vaccination status has a direct effect on vaccination reaction and getting smallpox. Getting smallpox has a direct effect on black hair. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on black hair. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 27%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 37%. Will vaccination decrease the chance of black hair?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, vaccination will not decrease the chance of black hair. This is because the probability of black hair is higher for vaccinated individuals (37%) compared to unvaccinated individuals (27%). Therefore, getting vaccinated increases the likelihood of having black hair, not decreases it.<|end_of_text|>
