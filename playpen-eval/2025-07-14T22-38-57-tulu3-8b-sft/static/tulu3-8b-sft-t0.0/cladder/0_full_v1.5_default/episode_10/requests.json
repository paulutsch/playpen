For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nYes, it would be less likely to see college admission for smokers if they had been nonsmokers. This is because smoking has a direct negative effect on college admission, and the probability of college admission is significantly lower for smokers (22%) compared to nonsmokers (76%). Therefore, if a smoker had not smoked, their probability of college admission would have been higher, assuming all other factors remain constant.<|end_of_text|>",
