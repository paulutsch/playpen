Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction.

This is because the conditions in the hypothetical world are such that high poverty or a global water company causes clean water, and high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. Since the region has low poverty and the person is served by a global water company, they would be exposed to clean water, which would not cause them to contract cholera.<|end_of_text|>",
