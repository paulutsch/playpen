To determine this, we can use the law of total probability. \n\nLet's denote the following events:\n- Rixq = R\n- Xevu = X\n- Not Rixq = ~R\n- Not Xevu = ~X\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- P(R) = 0.40\n- P(~R ∩ ~X) = 0.09\n- P(R ∩ X) = 0.22\n\nWe want to find P(X|R), the probability of Xevu given Rixq. Using the law of total probability, we can express P(X) as follows:\n\nP(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R)\n\nWe also know that P(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R) + P(X|R ∩ ~X)P(R ∩ ~X)\n\nSince P(X|R ∩ ~X) = 0 (because Rixq and Xevu cannot both be false), we can simplify this to:\n\nP(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R)\n\nNow, we can solve for P(X|R):\n\nP(X|R) = (P(X) - P(X|~R)P(~R)) / P",
