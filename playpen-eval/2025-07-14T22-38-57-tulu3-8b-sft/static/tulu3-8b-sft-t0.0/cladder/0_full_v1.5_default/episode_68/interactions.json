The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of rixq is 40%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 9%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 22%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

To determine this, we can use the law of total probability. \n\nLet's denote the following events:\n- Rixq = R\n- Xevu = X\n- Not Rixq = ~R\n- Not Xevu = ~X\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- P(R) = 0.40\n- P(~R ∩ ~X) = 0.09\n- P(R ∩ X) = 0.22\n\nWe want to find P(X|R), the probability of Xevu given Rixq. Using the law of total probability, we can express P(X) as follows:\n\nP(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R)\n\nWe also know that P(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R) + P(X|R ∩ ~X)P(R ∩ ~X)\n\nSince P(X|R ∩ ~X) = 0 (because Rixq and Xevu cannot both be false), we can simplify this to:\n\nP(X) = P(X|R)P(R) + P(X|~R)P(~R)\n\nNow, we can solve for P(X|R):\n\nP(X|R) = (P(X) - P(X|~R)P(~R)) / P",
