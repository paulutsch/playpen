The probability of talent is 9% for both attractive and unattractive people, which means that talent is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, the overall probability of talent is 9% (0.56 * 0.09 + 0.44 * 0.09 = 0.09). The probability of lack of talent is 91% (1 - 0.09 = 0.91).<|end_of_text|>",
