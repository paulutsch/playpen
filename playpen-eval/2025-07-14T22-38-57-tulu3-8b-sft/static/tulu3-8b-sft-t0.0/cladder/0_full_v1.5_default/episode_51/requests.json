The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For people who do not have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 88%. For people who do not have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 45%. For people who have a brother and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 58%. For people who have a brother and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 13%. For people who do not have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 9%. For people who have a brother, the probability of alarm set by wife is 64%.

The probability of the alarm ringing is higher when the wife sets the alarm, regardless of whether the person has a brother or not. In fact, the probability of the alarm ringing is higher when the person has a brother and the wife sets the alarm (13%) compared to when the person does not have a brother and the wife sets the alarm (45%). Therefore, having a brother does not negatively affect the alarm clock through the wife.<|end_of_text|>",
