Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%.

The probability of arriving to school on time is higher when Alice wakes up late (78%) compared to when she wakes up on time (46%). However, this does not mean that waking up late increases the chance of arriving to school on time. Instead, it suggests that there might be other factors at play that are influencing the probability of arriving to school on time. For example, Alice might be more motivated or have better time management skills when she wakes up late, which could be the reason for the higher probability of arriving to school on time.<|end_of_text|>",
