	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of ringing alarm is not larger when observing having a brother. The probability of ringing alarm is 64% when not having a brother, and 0% when having a brother. Therefore, the probability of ringing alarm is higher when not having a brother.<|end_of_text|>
