The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

          "content": "No, arriving to school on time is not more likely than arriving to school late overall. This is because the overall probability of arriving to school on time is a weighted average of the probabilities of arriving on time given waking up on time and waking up late. The probability of waking up on time is 95% (100% - 5%), and the probability of arriving on time given waking up on time is 52%. Therefore, the overall probability of arriving on time is 0.95 * 0.52 = 0.494 or 49.4%. The probability of waking up late is 5%, and the probability of arriving on time given waking up late is 87%. Therefore, the overall probability of arriving on time is 0.05 * 0.87 = 0.0435 or 4.35%. The overall probability of arriving on time is 49.4% + 4.35% = 53.75%. The overall probability of arriving late is 100% - 53.75% = 46.25%. Therefore, arriving to school late is more likely than arriving to school on time overall.<|end_of_text|>",
