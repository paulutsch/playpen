	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, arriving to school on time is not more likely than arriving to school late overall. This is because the overall probability of arriving to school on time is a weighted average of the probabilities of arriving on time given waking up on time and waking up late. The probability of waking up on time is 95% (100% - 5%), and the probability of arriving on time given waking up on time is 52%. Therefore, the overall probability of arriving on time is 0.95 * 0.52 = 0.494 or 49.4%. The probability of waking up late is 5%, and the probability of arriving on time given waking up late is 87%. Therefore, the overall probability of arriving on time is 0.05 * 0.87 = 0.0435 or 4.35%. The overall probability of arriving on time is 49.4% + 4.35% = 53.75%. The overall probability of arriving late is 100% - 53.75% = 46.25%. Therefore, arriving to school late is more likely than arriving to school on time overall.<|end_of_text|>
