The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of an employee being fired is higher when both the CEO and the manager agree to fire the employee (74%) compared to when only the CEO decides to fire the employee (60%). However, the overall probability of a CEO's decision to fire an employee is 18%, which is lower than the probability when both the CEO and the manager agree to fire the employee (74%). This suggests that the manager's decision to sign the termination letter does not significantly increase the chance of the employee being fired, as the probability of firing is already higher when both the CEO and the manager agree.<|end_of_text|>",
