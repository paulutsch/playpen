This is because the overall probability of muvq can be calculated as follows: 1% of the population is yupt and 59% of those who are yupt are muvq, which means 0.01 * 0.59 = 0.0059 or 0.59% of the population is muvq. The remaining 99% of the population is not yupt and 33% of those who are not yupt are muvq, which means 0.99 * 0.33 = 0.327 or 32.7% of the population is muvq. Therefore, the overall probability of muvq is 0.59% + 32.7% = 33.29%, which is more than 50%, but not more than 33%.<|end_of_text|>",
