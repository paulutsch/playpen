Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. For people in the dry season, the probability of wet ground is 40%. For in the rainy season, the probability of wet ground is 50%. Will rainy season increase the chance of wet ground?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\n",

This is because the probability of wet ground is higher during the rainy season (50%) compared to the dry season (40%). The direct effect of weather on ground, and the direct effect of sprinkler on ground, do not change this relationship.<|end_of_text|>",
