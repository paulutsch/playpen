This is because the causal relationship between Jyka and glimx is indirect, mediated by zory. Even if zuph is present, the direct effect of Jyka on glimx through zory would still be the primary determinant of glimx. Therefore, the presence or absence of zuph would not change the causal effect of Jyka on glimx.<|end_of_text|>",
