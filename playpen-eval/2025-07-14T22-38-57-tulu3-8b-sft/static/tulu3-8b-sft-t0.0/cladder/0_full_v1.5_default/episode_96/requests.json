Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox.

This is because jyka has a direct effect on yupt, which in turn has a direct effect on kwox. Therefore, even if an individual is not jyka, the effect of yupt on kwox would still be present, making it possible for the individual to be kwox.<|end_of_text|>",
