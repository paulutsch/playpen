	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Qwiu has a direct effect on jyka and kwox. Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox. We observed an individual is not qwiu. Would an individual is not kwox if not jyka instead of jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, an individual is not kwox if not jyka instead of jyka. This is because jyka has a direct effect on yupt, which in turn has a direct effect on kwox. Therefore, even if an individual is not jyka, the effect of yupt on kwox would still be present, making it possible for the individual to be kwox.<|end_of_text|>
