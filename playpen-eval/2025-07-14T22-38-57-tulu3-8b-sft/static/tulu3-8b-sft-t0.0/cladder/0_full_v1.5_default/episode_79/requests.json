Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz. The overall probability of pexu is 41%. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%.

For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%. Is rukz more likely than not rukz overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, rukz is not more likely than not rukz overall. This is because the overall probability of rukz can be calculated by considering the probability of rukz for those who are pexu and those who are not pexu. The overall probability of rukz is the sum of the probability of rukz for those who are pexu and the probability of rukz for those who are not pexu, multiplied by the probability of being pexu and the probability of not being pexu, respectively. In this case, the overall probability of rukz is (0.41 * 0.22) + (0.59 * 0.66) = 0.0918 + 0.3894 = 0.4812. Since 0.4812 is less than 0.5, rukz is not more likely than not rukz overall.<|end_of_text|>",
