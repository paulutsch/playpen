Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%.

Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of glimx is not smaller when observing zuph. This is because the probability of zuph and glimx occurring together is 1%, which is a direct causal relationship between zuph and glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 8%, and the probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%. Therefore, observing zuph does not necessarily decrease the chance of glimx, as the direct causal relationship between zuph and glimx already exists.<|end_of_text|>",
