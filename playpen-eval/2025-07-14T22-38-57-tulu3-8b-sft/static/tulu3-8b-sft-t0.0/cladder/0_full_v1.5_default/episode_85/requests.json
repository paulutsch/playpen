Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 75%. The probability of not yomx and xevu is 22%. The probability of yomx and xevu is 56%.

This is because the probability of yomx and xevu is 56%, which is higher than the probability of not yomx and xevu (22%). This indicates that the presence of yomx increases the likelihood of xevu, not decreases it.<|end_of_text|>",
