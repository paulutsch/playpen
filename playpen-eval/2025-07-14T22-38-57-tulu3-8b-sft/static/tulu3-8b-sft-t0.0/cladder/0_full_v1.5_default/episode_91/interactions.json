The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on zory and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 34%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 64%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 28%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We know that the probability of zuph is 34%, and the probability of not zuph is 100% - 34% = 66%. We also know that the probability of glimx given zuph is 28%, and the probability of glimx given not zuph is 64%.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can calculate the overall probability of glimx as follows:\n\nP(glimx) = P(glimx|zuph) * P(zuph) + P(glimx|not zuph) * P(not zuph)\n\nP(glimx) = (28% * 34%) + (64% * 66%)\n\nP(glimx) = 9.52% + 42.24%\n\nP(glimx) = 51.76%\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of glimx is 51.76%, which is higher than the probability of glimx given zuph (28%). This means that the chance of glimx is not smaller when observing zuph.<|end_of_text|>",
