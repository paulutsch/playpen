The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's define the following events:\n\n- E: Encouragement\n- D: Discouragement\n- B: Brown eyes\n- S: Studying habit\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(E) = 0.91\n- P(D) = 0.07\n- P(B|E) = 0.58\n- P(B|D) = 0.07\n\nWe need to find P(B|E), the probability of brown eyes given encouragement. Using the law of total probability, we can express P(B) as follows:\n\nP(B) = P(B|E)P(E) + P(B|D)P(D)\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities, we get:\n\nP(B) = (0.58 * 0.91) + (0.07 * 0.07)\nP(B) = 0.5278 + 0.0049\nP(B) = 0.5327\n\nNow, we can find P(B|E) by dividing P(B) by P(E):\n\nP(B|E) = P(B) / P(E)\nP(B|E) = 0.5327 / 0.91\nP(B|E) = 0.585\n\nSo, the probability of brown eyes given encouragement is 0",
