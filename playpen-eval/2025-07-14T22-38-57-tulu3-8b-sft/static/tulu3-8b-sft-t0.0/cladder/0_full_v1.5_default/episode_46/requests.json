To determine the overall probability of thick lips, we need to consider both the probability of receiving treatment and the probability of having thick lips given treatment. The overall probability of thick lips is the sum of the probability of having thick lips given treatment and the probability of having thick lips given no treatment, weighted by the probability of receiving treatment and not receiving treatment, respectively. In this case, the overall probability of thick lips is (0.48 * 0.29) + (0.52 * 0.64) = 0.1392 + 0.3328 = 0.472. Since 0.472 is less than 0.5, thick lips are not more likely than thin lips overall.<|end_of_text|>",
