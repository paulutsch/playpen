The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%. Is the chance of kwoz smaller when observing kwox?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of kwox and kwoz occurring together is 21%, which is higher than the probability of kwox alone (28%) and the probability of kwoz alone (which can be calculated as 21% + 65% - 28% = 58%). This indicates that kwox and kwoz are positively correlated, meaning that the presence of kwox increases the likelihood of kwoz. Therefore, observing kwox does not decrease the chance of kwoz, but rather increases it.<|end_of_text|>",
