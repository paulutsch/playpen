Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%.

This is because kwox and kwoz are not independent. The probability of kwox and kwoz occurring together is 21%, which is higher than the probability of kwox alone (28%) and the probability of kwoz alone (which can be calculated as 21% + 65% - 28% = 58%). This indicates that kwox and kwoz are positively correlated, meaning that the presence of kwox increases the likelihood of kwoz. Therefore, observing kwox does not decrease the chance of kwoz, but rather increases it.<|end_of_text|>",
