The probability of an employee being fired is higher when a CEO has visited England, but this is likely due to confounding factors. For example, CEOs who have visited England may be more likely to fire employees due to other factors unrelated to the visit itself, such as a more aggressive management style or a more competitive industry. Therefore, it is not accurate to conclude that visiting England directly increases the chance of an employee being fired.<|end_of_text|>",
