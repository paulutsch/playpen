Positive reinforcement training: This method involves rewarding your puppy for good behavior with treats, praise, or playtime. It's a gentle and effective way to teach your puppy basic commands and good manners.\n\n2. Clicker training: This method uses a clicker to mark the exact moment your puppy performs a desired behavior, followed by a reward. It's a quick and efficient way to train your puppy and can be used for a variety of commands and tricks.\n\n3. Crate training: Crate training involves teaching your puppy to feel comfortable and safe in a crate, which can be a useful tool for housebreaking and providing a safe space for your puppy when you can't supervise them.\n\n4. Socialization: Socializing your puppy early on is important for their overall development and can help prevent behavioral issues later on. Expose your puppy to a variety of people, animals, and environments to help them become well-adjusted and confident.\n\nWhich one you choose?<|end_of_text|>",
