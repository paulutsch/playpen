Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.\n<|assistant|>\n\"Let's denote the number of members with 3 pets as \\( x \\). Each of these \\( x \\) members has 3 pets, so they contribute a total of \\( 3x \\) pets to the family.\n\nThe remaining \\( 20 - x \\) members each have at least one pet, so they contribute at least \\( 20 - x \\) pets to the family.\n\nThe total number of pets is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + (20 - x) \\geq 32 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 20 - x \\geq 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2x + 20 \\geq 32 \\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2x \\geq 12 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x \\geq 6 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 6.\n\nFinal answer: 6.\"<|end_of_text|>",
