Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + (20 - x) \\geq 32 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 20 - x \\geq 32 \\]\n\n\\[ 2x + 20 \\geq 32 \\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2x \\geq 12 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x \\geq 6 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 6.\n\nFinal answer: 6.\"<|end_of_text|>",
