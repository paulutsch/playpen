	 I was walking down the street when I saw a man standing in front of a store. He was holding a sign that said "Help me." I stopped and asked him what he needed. He said he was hungry and had no money to buy food. I felt bad for him and decided to help him out. I gave him some money and told him to go buy something to eat. He thanked me and went into the store. I continued walking down the street, feeling good about helping someone in need.<|end_of_text|>
