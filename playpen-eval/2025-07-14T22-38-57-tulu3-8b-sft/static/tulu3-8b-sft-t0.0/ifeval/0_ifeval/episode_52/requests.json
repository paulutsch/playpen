Your response should contain less than 10 sentences and no commas.\n<|assistant|>\nI was walking home from school when I noticed a car following me. I tried to ignore it but it kept getting closer. I started to feel scared and I didn't know what to do. I tried to walk faster but the car kept up with me. I finally turned down a side street and ran into my house. I locked the door and called my mom. She told me to stay inside and not to go outside. I was shaking and I couldn't stop thinking about the car. I didn't know what to do but I knew I had to stay safe.<|end_of_text|>",
