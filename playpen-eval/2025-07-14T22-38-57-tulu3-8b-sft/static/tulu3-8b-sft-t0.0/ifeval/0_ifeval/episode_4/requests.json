Your response must contain a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>. Use less than 5 sentences.\n<|assistant|>\n<<Impact of Axle Weight on Road Damage>>\n\nWhen the weight on an axle increases, it places greater stress on the road surface. This increased stress can lead to more rapid deterioration of the road, including potholes and cracks. The heavier load compacts the road material, reducing its lifespan and requiring more frequent maintenance. Consequently, roads designed for lighter loads may suffer significant damage more quickly under heavier axle weights.<|end_of_text|>",
