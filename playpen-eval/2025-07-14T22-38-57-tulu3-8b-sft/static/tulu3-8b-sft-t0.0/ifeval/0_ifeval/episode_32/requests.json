The word \"clever\" is a direct translation of \"smart,\" but in German, it's more common to use \"intelligent\" or \"begabt\" when referring to someone's intellectual abilities. Additionally, the word order in German often differs from English, so it might be more natural to say \"Werner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht sehr intelligent.\"<|end_of_text|>",
