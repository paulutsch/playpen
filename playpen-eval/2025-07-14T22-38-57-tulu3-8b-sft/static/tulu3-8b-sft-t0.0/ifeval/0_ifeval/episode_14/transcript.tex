	 Subject: Introducing a New Album to You\\ \tt \\ \tt Hi Luheng,\\ \tt \\ \tt I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share something with you that I think you'll really enjoy. I recently discovered an album called "Lilith," and I've been absolutely captivated by it. The music is so unique and has a really special vibe that I think you'll appreciate.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'd love to hear your thoughts on it if you decide to give it a listen. Let me know if you want me to send you a link or if you'd like to listen to it together sometime.\\ \tt \\ \tt Take care and talk soon!\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]\\ \tt \\ \tt P.S. I think you'll love the way the album's soundscapes evolve throughout the tracks. Let me know if you want me to send you a link to listen to it!<|end_of_text|>
