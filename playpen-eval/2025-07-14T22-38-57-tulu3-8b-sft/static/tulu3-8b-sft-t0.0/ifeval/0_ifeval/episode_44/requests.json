Your entire response should have exactly 4 paragraphs.  Separate paragraphs with the markdown divider: ***\n<|assistant|>\nDay 1: The Great Escape\n\nThe adventure begins with a grand departure from the dorms at the crack of dawn. The students will embark on a quest to find the elusive \"Breakfast Oasis,\" a mythical place rumored to serve the world's most epic breakfast burritos. After conquering this culinary challenge, they will head to the \"Mystery Beach,\" where the only map is a cryptic clue left by a wise old sea captain. Once there, they will engage in a friendly competition of beach volleyball, where the rules are simple: no one knows them, and the ball is made of foam.\n\n***\n\nDay 2: The Quest for Knowledge\n\nOn the second day, the students will venture into the heart of the \"Knowledge Forest,\" a place where every tree holds a secret. Armed with nothing but their wits and a compass that points to the nearest snack bar, they will embark on a scavenger hunt for the legendary \"Wisdom Stones.\" These stones, said to grant insight into the mysteries of the universe, are hidden in the most unexpected places. Along the way, they will encounter riddles and puzzles that will test their intellect and teamwork.\n\n***\n\nDay 3: The Grand Finale\n\nThe final day of the trip is reserved for the ultimate challenge: the \"Infinite Maze.\" This labyrinthine maze is said to have no exit, but the students are determined to find it. Equipped with nothing but a flashlight and a sense of humor, they will navigate through corridors of confusion, encountering illusions and mirages. The prize for those who emerge victorious? A feast fit for kings, with a menu that includes every student's favorite comfort food, prepared by the legendary \"Culinary Wizard.\"\n\n***\n\nAs the sun sets on their final day, the students will reflect on their epic journey, filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a few bruises from the volleyball court. They will return to their dorms, not just as students, but as heroes of their own hilarious adventure, ready to share tales of their escapades with anyone who will listen. And so ends the most memorable trip to the \"Great Learning Grounds,\" a tale that will be told for generations to come.<|end_of_text|>",
