  "input": "Question:\nDiscuss the work cycle and its four human factors components.\nOptions:\nA. Work cycle is a repetitive pattern of work, and its four human factors components are: anticipation processes, learning processes, coordination processes, and endurance processes.\nB. Work cycle is the duration from one break to the next, and its four human factors components are: attention processes, memory consolidation, intuitive processes, and strength processes.\nC. Work cycle is the process of planning and executing a series of tasks, and its four human factors components are: sensory perception, knowledge retrieval, creativity processes, and agility processes.\nD. Work cycle is a series of tasks to be performed in a specific order, and its four human factors components are: sensory processes, memory processes, decision-making processes, and reflex processes.\nE. Work cycle is the time it takes for a worker to return to the starting point of a task, and its four human factors components are: visual processing, auditory processing, strategic thinking, and precision processes.\nF. Work cycle is the interval between the initiation and completion of a project, and its four human factors components are: situational awareness, mental modeling, risk assessment, and psychomotor functions.\nG. Work cycle refers to the period of work before a break, and its four human factors components are: perceptual processes, recall processes, problem-solving processes, and emotional processes.\nH. Work cycle is the sequence of operations performed by a machine or worker, and its four human factors components are: input processes, processing processes, output processes, and feedback processes.\nI. Work cycle is the complete sequence of events necessary to complete a task, and its four human factors components are: perceptual processes, recall processes, problem solving (decision-making) processes, and muscular (motor) processes.\nJ. Work cycle is the sum of all tasks completed in a day, and its four human factors components are: cognitive processes, emotional processes, problem solving processes, and physical processes.\n",
