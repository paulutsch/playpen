A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\nOptions:\nA. 3 + e^-2\nB. 2 - e^-4\nC. 2 - e^-2\nD. 3 + e^-4\nE. 2 + e^-3\nF. 2 - e^-3\nG. 3 - e^-2\nH. 2 + e^-2\nI. 2 + e^-4\nJ. 2\nThe answer is (I)\n\nQuestion:\nA total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?\nOptions:\nA. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.\nB. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.\nC. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.\nD. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.\nE. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.\nF. Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.\nG. N/A\nH. N/A\nI. N/A\nJ. N/A\nThe answer is (B)\n\nQuestion:\nWhich expression is another way to show 8 x 6?\nOptions:\nA. (2x4)x6\nB. (24+4)+6\nC.
