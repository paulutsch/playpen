Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nOptions:\nA. 1000 times more\nB. 50 times more\nC. 5000 times more\nD. 500 times more\nE. 10000 times more\nF. 20000 times more\nG. 2000 times more\nH. 100 times more\nI. 10 times more\nJ. N/A\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nOptions:\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nE. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.\nF.

The angular magnification of the telescope is\nOptions:\nA. 10\nB. 40\nC. 6\nD. 25\nE. 15\nF. 50\nG. 30\nH. 4\nI. 5\nJ. 20\nThe answer is (H)\n\nQuestion:\nColors in a soap bubble result from light\nOptions:\nA. dispersion\nB. deflection\nC. refraction\nD. reflection\nE. interference\nF. converted to a different frequency\nG. polarization\nH. absorption\nI. diffraction\nJ. transmission\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nA microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nOptions:\nA. 240 W\nB. 120 W\nC. 10 W\nD. 480 W\nE. 360 W\nF. 200 W\nG. 30 W\nH. 150 W\nI. 60 W\nJ. 300 W\nThe answer is (A)\n\nQuestion:\nA heavy object can sink into the ground during an earthquake if the shaking causes the ground to undergo liquefaction, in which the soil grains experience little friction as they slide over one another. The ground is then effectively quicksand. The possibility of liquefaction in sandy ground can be predicted in terms of the void ratio $e$ for a sample of the ground:\n$$\ne=\\frac{V_{\\text {voids }}}{V_{\\text {grains }}}.\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\text {grains }}$ is the total volume of the sand grains in the sample and $V_{\\text {voids }}$ is the total volume between the grains (in the voids). If $e$ exceeds a critical value of 0.80, liquefaction can occur during an earthquake. What is the corresponding sand density $\\rho_{\\text {sand }}$?
