The total cost per period is $412.5.\n\nThe present value of the total cost for 3 periods is:\nPV = $412.5 * (1 + 0.0225)^(-3) = $412.5 * 0.975 = $401.44\n\nThe theoretical forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months is:\nF = P + PV\n= $412 + $401.44\n= $813.44\n\nHowever, this is the price for delivery in 3 quarters. Since the question asks for the price for delivery in 9 months, which is 2.25 quarters, we need to calculate the price for 2.25 quarters.\n\nThe price for 2.25 quarters is:\nF",
