Calculate the total tax rate: \n   0.41 + 0.02 + 0.001 + 0.089 = 0.522\n\n2. Calculate the tax for each need:\n   Local college fund: 0.41 * 16500 / 100 = 678.15\n   Special education: 0.02 * 16500 / 100 = 33\n   Health and welfare: 0.001 * 16500 / 100 = 0.165\n   Community construction: 0.089 * 16500 / 100 = 146.55\n\n3. Calculate the total tax:\n   Total tax = 678.15 + 33 + 0.165 + 146.55 = 857.83\n\nHowever, the closest answer is not available in the options, but the correct total tax is $857.83.<|eot_id|>",
