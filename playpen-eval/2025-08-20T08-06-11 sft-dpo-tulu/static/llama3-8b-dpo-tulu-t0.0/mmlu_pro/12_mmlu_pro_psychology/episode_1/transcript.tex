	 The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about psychology. Answer only with "The answer is (X)" where X is the correct letter choice.\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information.

Work cycle is a repetitive pattern of work, and its four human factors components are: anticipation processes, learning processes, coordination processes, and endurance processes.\\ \tt B. Work cycle is the duration from one break to the next, and its four human factors components are: attention processes, memory consolidation, intuitive processes, and strength processes.\\ \tt C. Work cycle is the process of planning and executing a series of tasks, and its four human factors components are: sensory perception, knowledge retrieval, creativity processes, and agility processes.\\ \tt D. Work cycle is a series of tasks to be performed in a specific order, and its four human factors components are: sensory processes, memory processes, decision-making processes, and reflex processes.\\ \tt E. Work cycle is the time it takes for a worker to return to the starting point of a task, and its four human factors components are: visual processing, auditory processing, strategic thinking, and precision processes.\\ \tt F. Work cycle is the interval between the initiation and completion of a project, and its four human factors components are: situational awareness, mental modeling, risk assessment, and psychomotor functions.\\ \tt G. Work cycle refers to the period of work before a break, and its four human factors components are: perceptual processes, recall processes, problem-solving processes, and emotional processes.\\ \tt H. Work cycle is the sequence of operations performed by a machine or worker, and its four human factors components are: input processes, processing processes, output processes, and feedback processes.\\ \tt I.
