The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are interested in the effect of the manager's decision to sign the termination letter on the probability of large feet, while controlling for the CEO's decision to fire the employee.\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n\n- L: Large feet\n- F: CEO fires the employee\n- S: Manager signs the termination letter\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(L|F, S=0) = 0.15 (CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters)\n- P(L|F, S=1) = 0.35 (CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters)\n- P(L|F, S=0) = 0.83 (CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters)\n- P(F) = 0.94 (overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee)\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of large feet for CEOs who fire employees as follows:\n\nP(L|F) = P(F) * P(L|F, S=1) * P(S=1|F) + P(F) * P(L|F, S=0) * P(S=0|F)\n= 0.94 * 0.35 * P(S=1|F) +",
