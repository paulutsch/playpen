The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. Demand has a direct effect on supply and price.\n2. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply.\n3. Supply has a direct effect on price.\n4. Demand is unobserved.\n5. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%.\n6. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%.\n7. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%.\n\nWe are interested in comparing the likelihood of increased price versus reduced price. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes of supply changes. Let's define two counterfactuals:\n\n- Counterfactual 1 (CF1): Reduced supply\n- Counterfactual 2 (CF2): Increased supply\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n\n- The probability of CF1 is 1 - 0.78 = 0.22 (since the overall probability of increased supply is 78%).\n- For CF1, the probability of increased price is 0.44.\n- The probability of CF2 is 0.78.\n- For CF2, the probability of increased price is 0.81.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential outcomes of price changes.
