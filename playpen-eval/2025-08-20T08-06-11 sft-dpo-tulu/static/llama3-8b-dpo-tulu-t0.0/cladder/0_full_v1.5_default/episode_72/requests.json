The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Cwoi has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. Cwoi is unobserved. For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%. For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%. For those who are not yomx, the probability of gwet is 64%. For those who are yomx, the probability of gwet is 8%. For those who are yomx, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are comparing the probability of xevu for individuals who are yomx to those who are not yomx, but we are also considering the effect of the unobserved variable cwoi. \n\nWe can use the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect of yomx on xevu. The backdoor path from yomx to xevu is through gwet. We can use the g-formula to estimate the causal effect of yomx on xevu:\n\nP(xevu | yomx) = P(xevu | yomx, gwet) * P(gwet | yomx) + P(xevu | yomx, not gwet) * P(not gwet | yomx)\n\nP(xevu | yomx) = 0.91 * 0.08 + 0.31 * 0.92\nP(xevu | yomx) = 0.0732 + 0.2864\nP(xevu | yomx) = 0.3596\n\nFor those who are not yomx, we can use the law of total probability to estimate the probability of xevu:\n\nP(xevu |",
