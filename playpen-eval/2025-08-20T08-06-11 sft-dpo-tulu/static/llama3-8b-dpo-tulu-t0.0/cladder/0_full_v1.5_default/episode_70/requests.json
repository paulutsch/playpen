Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. The overall probability of xevo is 48%. For those who are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 39%. For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%.

We can do this by considering two groups: those who are Xevo and those who are not Xevo.\n\nLet P(Xevo) = 0.48 (the probability of Xevo)\nLet P(Gyzp|Xevo) = 0.78 (the probability of Gyzp given Xevo)\nLet P(Gyzp|~Xevo) = 0.39 (the probability of Gyzp given not Xevo)\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of Gyzp:\n\nP(Gyzp) = P(Xevo) * P(Gyzp|Xevo) + P(~Xevo) * P(Gyzp|~Xevo)\n= 0.48 * 0.78 + (1 - 0.48) * 0.39\n= 0.3744 + 0.1956\n= 0.57\n\nSince the overall probability of Gyzp (0.57) is greater than 0.5, we might initially think that Gyzp is more likely than not Gyzp overall. However, this is where the causal relationships come into play.\n\nWe are given that Xevo has a direct effect on Tijw and Tijv",
