The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%. Is the chance of kwoz smaller when observing kwox?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Since Muvy is unobserved, we need to use the backdoor adjustment formula to estimate the causal effect of kwox on kwoz.\n\nLet's denote the probability of kwoz given kwox as P(kwoz|kwox) and the probability of kwoz given not kwox as P(kwoz|not kwox). We can use the law of total probability to express P(kwoz) as:\n\nP(kwoz) = P(kwox) * P(kwoz|kwox) + P(not kwox) * P(kwoz|not kwox)\n\nWe are given that P(kwox) = 0.28, P(not kwox and kwoz) = 0.65, and P(kwox and kwoz) = 0.21. We can use these values to calculate P(kwoz|kwox) and P(kwoz|not kwox).\n\nFirst, we can calculate P(kwoz|kwox) by dividing P(kwox and kwoz) by P(kwox):\n\nP(kwoz|kwox) = P(kwox and kwoz) / P(kwox) = 0",
