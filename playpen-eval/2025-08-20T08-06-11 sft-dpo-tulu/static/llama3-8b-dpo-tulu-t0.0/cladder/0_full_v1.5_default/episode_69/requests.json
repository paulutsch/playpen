The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%. Is the chance of kwoz smaller when observing kwox?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since Muvy is unobserved, we need to use the backdoor adjustment formula to estimate the causal effect of kwox on kwoz.\n\nLet's denote the probability of kwoz given kwox as P(kwoz|kwox) and the probability of kwoz given not kwox as P(kwoz|not kwox). We can use the law of total probability to express P(kwoz) as:\n\nP(kwoz) = P(kwox) * P(kwoz|kwox) + P(not kwox) * P(kwoz|not kwox)\n\nWe are given that P(kwox) = 0.28, P(not kwox and kwoz) = 0.65, and P(kwox and kwoz) = 0.21. We can use these values to calculate P(kwoz|kwox) and P(kwoz|not kwox).\n\nFirst, we can calculate P(kwoz|kwox) by dividing P(kwox and kwoz) by P(kwox):\n\nP(kwoz|kwox) = P(kwox and kwoz) / P(kwox) = 0",
