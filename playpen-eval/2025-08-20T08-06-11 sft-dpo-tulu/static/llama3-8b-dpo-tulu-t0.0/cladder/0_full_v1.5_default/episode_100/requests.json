We are asked to consider a counterfactual scenario where Zuph is instead not Zuph (i.e., Zuph is 0).\n\nTo determine the effect of this change on Glimx, we need to consider the causal paths from Jyka to Glimx. There are two paths: Jyka -> Zory -> Glimx and Jyka -> Zuph -> Glimx.\n\nIf Zuph is 0, the first path (Jyka -> Zory -> Glimx) remains unaffected, as Zory's value is determined by Jyka. However, the second path (Jyka -> Zuph -> Glimx) is blocked, as Zuph is 0.\n\nSince the second path is blocked, the effect of Jyka on Glimx is mediated solely through the first path (Jyka -> Zory -> Glimx). Therefore, the value of Glimx is determined solely by the value of Zory, which is determined by Jyka.\n\nIn other words, the causal effect",
