	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine if the chance of brown eyes is larger when observing encouragement, we need to calculate the probability of brown eyes given encouragement (P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement)) and compare it to the overall probability of brown eyes (P(Brown Eyes)).\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's calculate P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement) using Bayes' theorem:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement) = P(Encouragement | Brown Eyes) * P(Brown Eyes) / P(Encouragement)\\ \tt \\ \tt We know:\\ \tt - P(Encouragement) = 0.91\\ \tt - P(Brown Eyes) = 0.07 (since the probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%, and the overall probability of encouragement is 91%, the remaining probability is 7% for discouragement and brown eyes)\\ \tt - P(Encouragement | Brown Eyes) = 0.58 (probability of encouragement and brown eyes)\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's plug in the values:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement) = 0.58 * 0.07 / 0.91\\ \tt P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement) = 0.0046 / 0.91\\ \tt P(Brown Eyes | Encouragement) = 0.0051\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, let's compare this to the overall probability of brown eyes (P(Brown Eyes) = 0.07). Since 0.0051 is less than
