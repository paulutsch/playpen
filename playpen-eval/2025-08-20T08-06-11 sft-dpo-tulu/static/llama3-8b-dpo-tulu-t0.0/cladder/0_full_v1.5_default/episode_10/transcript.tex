	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 76%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 22%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, let's break down the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission.\\ \tt 2. Effort has a direct effect on college admission.\\ \tt 3. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 76%.\\ \tt 4. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 22%.\\ \tt \\ \tt The question asks whether, given that a student is a smoker, it would be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker. This is a counterfactual question, which can be addressed using potential outcomes and the counterfactual framework.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Y(1) = College admission if the student is a smoker\\ \tt - Y(0) = College admission if the student is a nonsmoker\\ \tt \\ \tt We are interested in the probability of Y(0) given that Y(1) = 0 (i.e., the student is a smoker and did not get admitted). Using the counterfactual framework, we can express this as P(Y(0) | Y(1) = 0).\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the joint distribution of Y(0) and Y(1). However, we are not given the joint distribution directly. Instead, we are given the marginal distributions of Y(0) and Y(1).\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the
