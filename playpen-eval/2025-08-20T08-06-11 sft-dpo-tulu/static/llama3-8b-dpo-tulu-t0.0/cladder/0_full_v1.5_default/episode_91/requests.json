Let's denote the variables as follows: Jyka = J, zory = Z, zuph = U, and glimx = G.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. P(U) = 0.34\n2. P(¬U ∧ G) = 0.64\n3. P(U ∧ G) = 0.28\n\nWe want to determine if P(G|U) < P(G). To do this, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(G|U) and compare it to P(G).\n\nFirst, we can calculate P(G) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(G) = P(¬U ∧ G) + P(U ∧ G)\n= 0.64 + 0.28\n= 0.92\n\nNext, we can calculate P(G|U) using the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(G|U) = P(U ∧ G) / P(U)\n= 0.28 / 0.34\n= 0.8235\n\nSince P(G|U) > P(G), the chance of glimx is not smaller when observing zuph.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the direct effects between the variables. We are given that zuph",
