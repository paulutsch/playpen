The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Given the conditions:\n\n- Unobserved confounders (U) has a direct effect on having a sister (S) and cholesterol level (C).\n- Treatment assignment (T) has a direct effect on having a sister (S).\n- Having a sister (S) has a direct effect on cholesterol level (C).\n- Unobserved confounders (U) is unobserved.\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of low cholesterol (C=0) when observing having a sister (S=1) versus not observing having a sister (S=0).\n\nFirst, let's define the probability distributions:\n\n- P(S=1) = 0.2 (probability of having a sister)\n- P(S=0) = 0.8 (probability of not having a sister)\n- P(C=0, S=0) = 0.65 (probability of low cholesterol and not having a sister)\n- P(C=0, S=1) = 0.14 (probability of low cholesterol and having a sister)\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate the probability of low cholesterol (C=0) when not observing having a sister (S=0):\n\nP(C=0) = P(C=0, S=0) + P(C=0, S=1) * P(S",
