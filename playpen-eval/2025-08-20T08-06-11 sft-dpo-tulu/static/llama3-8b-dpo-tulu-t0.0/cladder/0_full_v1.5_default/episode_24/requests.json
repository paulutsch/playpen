The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's denote the unobserved confounders as U, education level as E, proximity to a college as P, and salary as S.\n\nGiven the conditions:\n\n1. U has a direct effect on E and S.\n2. P has a direct effect on E.\n3. E has a direct effect on S.\n4. U is unobserved.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(S=high | P=far) = 0.39\n- P(S=high | P=close) = 0.49\n- P(E=college | P=far) = 0.57\n- P(E=college | P=close) = 0.30\n\nWe want to determine if E (college degree or higher) increases the chance of S (high salary). To do this, we need to use the potential outcomes framework and the concept of causal effects.\n\nLet's define the potential outcomes:\n\n- S(E=college, P=far) = the salary if someone has a college degree and lives far from a college\n- S(E=college, P=close) = the salary if someone has a college degree and lives close to a college\n- S(E=non-college, P=far) = the salary if someone does not have a college degree and lives far from a",
