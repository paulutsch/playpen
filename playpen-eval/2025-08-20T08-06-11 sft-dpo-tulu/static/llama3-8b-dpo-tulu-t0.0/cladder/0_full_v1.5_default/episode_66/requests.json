Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Rixq → zuph\n2. Rixq → xevu\n3. Swoy → zuph\n4. Swoy → xevu\n5. zuph → xevu\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(Rixq) = 0.7\n2. P(¬Rixq, Xevu) = 0.06\n3. P(Rixq, Xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe want to compare P(Xevu | Rixq) and P(Xevu | ¬Rixq). To do this, we need to use the law of total probability and the rules of conditional probability.\n\nLet's first find P(Xevu):\n\nP(Xevu) = P(Xevu, Rixq) + P(Xevu, ¬Rixq)\n= P(Rixq, Xevu) + P(¬Rixq, Xevu)\n= 0.1 + 0.06\n= 0.16\n\nNow, let's find P(Xevu | Rixq):\n\nP(Xevu | Rixq) = P(Xevu, Rixq) / P",
