The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on lirg. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%. Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
