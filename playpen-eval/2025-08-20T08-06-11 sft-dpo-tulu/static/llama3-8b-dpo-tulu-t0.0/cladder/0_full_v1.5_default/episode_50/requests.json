Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. P(B) = 0.01 (probability of having a brother)\n2. P(¬B, A) = 0.64 (probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm)\n3. P(B, A) = 0 (probability of having a brother and ringing alarm)\n\nWe want to determine if the chance of ringing alarm (A) is larger when observing having a brother (B). To do this, we need to compare the probability of ringing alarm in the presence of a brother (P(A|B)) to the probability of ringing alarm in the absence of a brother (P(A|¬B)).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express P(A|B) as:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A, B) / P(B) = 0 / 0.01 = 0\n\nSimilarly, we can express P(A|¬B) as:\n\nP(A|¬B) = P(A, ¬B) / P(¬B) = P(¬B, A) / (1 - P(B)) = 0.64 / (1 - 0.01",
