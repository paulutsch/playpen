	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, let's break down the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. The probability of male gender is 54%.\\ \tt 2. For individuals who are not male (i.e., female), the probability of admission acceptance is 49%.\\ \tt 3. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - The probability of being male and accepted is 0.54 * 0.24 = 0.1296.\\ \tt - The probability of being female and accepted is 0.46 * 0.49 = 0.2264.\\ \tt - The overall probability of admission acceptance is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.1296 + 0.2264 = 0.356.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's calculate the overall probability of admission rejection. Since the probability of admission acceptance is 0.356, the probability of admission rejection is 1 - 0.356 = 0.644.\\ \tt \\ \tt Comparing the overall probabilities, we see that admission rejection (0.644) is more likely than admission acceptance (0.356). Therefore, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.
