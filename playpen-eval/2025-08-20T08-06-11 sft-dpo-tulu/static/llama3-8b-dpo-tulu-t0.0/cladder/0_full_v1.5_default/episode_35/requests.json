The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 35%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are given the following direct effects:\n\n- CEO → Director\n- CEO → Having visited England\n- Having visited England → Employee\n- Director → Employee\n\nWe are also given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(Fired | Fired, Not Visited England) = 0.35 (for CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England)\n- P(Fired | Fired, Visited England) = 0.66 (for CEOs who fire employees and have visited England)\n- P(Fired | Not Fired, Not Visited England) = 1 - 0.28 (since the overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%) = 0.72 (for CEOs who have not fired employees and have not visited England)\n- P(Fired | Not Fired, Visited England) = 1 - 0.28 (since the overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%) = 0.72 (for CEOs who have not fired employees and have visited England)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of employee being fired given that the CEO has visited England as follows:\n\nP(Fired | Visited England) = P(Fired, Visited England) + P(Not Fired, Visited England)\n= P(Fired | Fired, Visited England) * P(F",
