This suggests that Gyzp is a common effect of both Xevo and Tijv. \n\nTo assess the effect of not Xevo on Gyzp, we need to consider the counterfactual scenario where Xevo is absent. In this scenario, the only cause of Gyzp is Tijv, since we know the individual is not Tijv. However, the question asks whether the individual would be Gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo. This is a subtle distinction, but it implies that we are considering a scenario where Xevo is present, but we are asking what would happen if we were to replace Xevo with its absence.\n\nIn this case, we are essentially asking whether the individual would be Gyzp if Tijv were the only cause of Gyzp. However, we know that the individual is not Tijv, so even if Tijv were the only cause of Gyzp, the individual would not be Gyzp.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No. The individual would not be Gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo, because the absence of Xevo does not change the fact that the individual is not Tijv, and Tijv is the only cause",
