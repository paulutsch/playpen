	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. We know that xevo or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is not tijv. Would an individual is gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt The given conditions imply that both Xevo and Tijv have a direct effect on Gyzp, and that at least one of them causes Gyzp. This suggests that Gyzp is a common effect of both Xevo and Tijv. \\ \tt \\ \tt To assess the effect of not Xevo on Gyzp, we need to consider the counterfactual scenario where Xevo is absent. In this scenario, the only cause of Gyzp is Tijv, since we know the individual is not Tijv. However, the question asks whether the individual would be Gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo. This is a subtle distinction, but it implies that we are considering a scenario where Xevo is present, but we are asking what would happen if we were to replace Xevo with its absence.\\ \tt \\ \tt In this case, we are essentially asking whether the individual would be Gyzp if Tijv were the only cause of Gyzp. However, we know that the individual is not Tijv, so even if Tijv were the only cause of Gyzp, the individual would not be Gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, the answer is No. The individual would not be Gyzp if not Xevo instead of Xevo, because the absence of Xevo does not change the fact that the individual is not Tijv, and Tijv is the only cause
