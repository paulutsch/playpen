The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%. Is employee being fired more likely than employee not being fired overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of a manager signing the termination letter is 35%.\n2. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of the employee being fired is 76%.\n3. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of the employee being fired is 42%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of the employee being fired by considering two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Manager signs the termination letter (35% chance)\n  - Probability of employee being fired given manager signs the termination letter: 42%\n  - Probability of this scenario occurring: 35% (manager signs the termination letter)\n  - Probability of employee being fired in this scenario: 35% * 42% = 0.147\n\n- Scenario 2: Manager doesn't sign the termination letter (65% chance)\n  - Probability of employee being fired given manager doesn't sign the termination letter: 76%\n  - Probability of this scenario occurring: 65% (manager doesn't sign the termination letter)\n  - Probability of employee being fired in this scenario: 65% * 76% = 0.494\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall probability of the employee being fired by summing the probabilities of the two scenarios:\n\nOverall probability of employee being fired = 0.147 + 0.494 = 0.641\n\nHowever",
