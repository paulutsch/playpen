	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on salary. Method 1: We look at how education level correlates with salary case by case according to skill. Method 2: We look directly at how education level correlates with salary in general. To understand how education level affects salary, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it is not more correct to use Method 1 than Method 2. \\ \tt \\ \tt Although Method 1, also known as the "instrumental variable" approach, can be useful in certain situations where there are confounding variables, in this hypothetical world, we are given that skill is the only mediator between education level and salary. This means that skill is the only confounding variable that affects both education level and salary.\\ \tt \\ \tt In this case, using Method 1 (controlling for skill) would essentially be equivalent to using Method 2 (looking directly at the correlation between education level and salary). This is because the direct effect of education level on salary is already accounted for by the mediator (skill), and controlling for skill would not provide any additional information.\\ \tt \\ \tt In fact, using Method 1 in this scenario would be an example of "over-controlling" or "over-adjusting" for a mediator, which can lead to biased estimates of the direct effect of interest (education level on salary). Therefore, in this hypothetical world, Method 2 is the more straightforward and correct approach to understanding how education level affects salary.
