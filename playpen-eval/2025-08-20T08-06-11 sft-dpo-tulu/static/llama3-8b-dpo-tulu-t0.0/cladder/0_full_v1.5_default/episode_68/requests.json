Let's denote the probability of xevu as P(xevu), the probability of rixq as P(rixq), and the probability of xevu given rixq as P(xevu|rixq).\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- P(rixq) = 0.4\n- P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.09\n- P(rixq and xevu) = 0.22\n\nWe can calculate P(xevu) using the law of total probability:\nP(xevu) = P(xevu and rixq) + P(xevu and not rixq)\n= P(rixq and xevu) + P(not rixq and xevu)\n= 0.22 + 0.09\n= 0.31\n\nNow, we need to calculate P(xevu|rixq) to determine if the chance of xevu is smaller when observing rixq:\nP(xevu|rixq) = P(rixq and xevu) / P(rixq)\n= 0.22 / 0.4\n= 0.55\n\nComparing P(xevu) and P(xevu|rix",
