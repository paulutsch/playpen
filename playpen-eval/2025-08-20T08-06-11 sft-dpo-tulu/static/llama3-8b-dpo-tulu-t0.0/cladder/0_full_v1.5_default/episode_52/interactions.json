The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 81%. For managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 46%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 49%. For managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 10%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 15%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 39%. For managers who sign termination letters, would it be less likely to see large feet if the manager had signed the termination letter?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are interested in the probability of large feet among managers who sign termination letters, compared to the probability of large feet among managers who do not sign termination letters.\n\nLet's denote the event of a manager signing the termination letter as M, the event of a director signing the termination letter as D, and the event of having large feet as L. We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(L|M, D') = 0.81 (probability of large feet among managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters)\n- P(L|M, D) = 0.46 (probability of large feet among managers who don't sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters)\n- P(L|M', D') = 0.49 (probability of large feet among managers who sign termination letters and directors who don't sign termination letters)\n- P(L|M', D) = 0.10 (probability of large feet among managers who sign termination letters and directors who sign termination letters)\n- P(D|M') = 0.15 (probability of director signing the termination letter among managers who don't sign termination letters)\n- P(D|M) = 0.39 (probability of director signing the termination letter among managers who",
