The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For people who have not visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 9%. For people who have not visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 54%. For people who have visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 46%. For people who have visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 90%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 17%. For people who have visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 27%. For people who have visited England, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the person had not visited England?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
