	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%. For those who are yomx, would it be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx for those who are yomx.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, let's break down the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Yomx has a direct effect on gwet.\\ \tt 2. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu.\\ \tt 3. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%.\\ \tt 4. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%.\\ \tt \\ \tt The question asks whether it would be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx for those who are yomx. This is a counterfactual question, which requires us to consider the probability of xevu if the individual was not yomx, but still belongs to the group that is yomx.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this, we need to consider the causal relationships and the effect of yomx on gwet and xevu. Since yomx has a direct effect on gwet, and gwet has a direct effect on xevu, we can infer that yomx has an indirect effect on xevu.\\ \tt \\ \tt The probability of xevu is 40% for those who are yomx. This is the observed probability. To answer the counterfactual question, we need to consider what would happen if the individual was not yomx, but still belongs to the group that
