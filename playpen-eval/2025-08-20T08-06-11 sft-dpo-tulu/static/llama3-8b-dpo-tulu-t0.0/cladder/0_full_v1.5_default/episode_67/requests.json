The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The backdoor criterion states that if we can block all backdoor paths from the treatment (rixq) to the outcome (xevu) using observed variables, then we can estimate the causal effect of rixq on xevu using observed data.\n\nIn this case, we have the following direct effects:\n\n- Rixq → zuph\n- Rixq → xevu\n- Swoy → zuph\n- Swoy → xevu\n- Zuph → xevu\n\nWe can see that there is a backdoor path from rixq to xevu through zuph: rixq → zuph → xevu. However, since swoy is unobserved, we cannot block this backdoor path using observed variables.\n\nTo estimate the causal effect of rixq on xevu, we need to use the frontdoor criterion or the instrumental variable (IV) approach. However, in this case, we can use the IV approach with rixq as the instrument and zuph as the intermediate variable.\n\nWe can use the formula for the IV estimator:\n\nP(xevu | rixq = 1) - P(xevu | rixq = 0) = (P(xevu | rix",
