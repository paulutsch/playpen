The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on gyzp and hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. Gyzp has a direct effect on lirg. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 63%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 49%. For those who are jyka, would it be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We have the following direct effects:\n\n- Jyka → gyzp and hwax\n- Hwax → lirg\n- Gyzp → lirg\n\nWe are also given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(lirg | not jyka) = 63%\n- P(lirg | jyka) = 49%\n\nThe question asks whether it would be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka. To answer this, we need to consider the potential effect of jyka on the probability of lirg through its direct effects on gyzp and hwax.\n\nSince gyzp and hwax are direct effects of jyka, and both have a direct effect on lirg, we can infer that jyka has an indirect effect on lirg through gyzp and hwax. However, the question is asking whether it would be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka, which implies that we are considering the effect of not being jyka on the probability of lirg.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the potential effect of not being jyka on the probability of lirg through the direct effects of gyz",
