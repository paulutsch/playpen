The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tijv has a direct effect on tijw and xevo. Xevo has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. For those who are not tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 29%. For those who are not tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 14%. For those who are tijv and are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 11%. For those who are tijv and are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 16%. The overall probability of tijv is 88%. Will xevo increase the chance of gyzp?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following groups:\n\n- Group 1: Not tijv and not xevo (reference group)\n- Group 2: Not tijv and xevo\n- Group 3: Tijv and not xevo\n- Group 4: Tijv and xevo\n\nThe probability of gyzp in each group is given:\n\n- Group 1: 29%\n- Group 2: 14%\n- Group 3: 11%\n- Group 4: 16%\n\nTo estimate the causal effect of xevo on gyzp, we need to compare the probability of gyzp in Group 2 to the probability of gyzp in Group 1, while controlling for the effect of tijv. We can do this by comparing the difference in probabilities between Group 2 and Group 1 to the difference in probabilities between Group 3 and Group 1.\n\nThe difference in probabilities between Group 2 and Group 1 is 14% - 29% = -15",
