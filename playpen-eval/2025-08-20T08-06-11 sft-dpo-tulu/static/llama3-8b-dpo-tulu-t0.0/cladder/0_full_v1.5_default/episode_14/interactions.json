The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationships between smoking, tar deposit, and lung cancer.\n\nFirst, we know that smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit, and tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. This implies that smoking is a common cause of both tar deposit and lung cancer. \n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- The overall probability of smoking is 12%.\n- For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%.\n- For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers and smokers separately. However, we cannot directly calculate the overall probability of lung cancer because we do not know the distribution of gender (the unobserved variable).\n\nHowever, we can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of lung cancer. Let's denote the probability of lung cancer as P(LC), the probability of smoking as P(S), and the probability of being a nonsmoker as P(NS). We also know that P(S) = 0.12 and P(NS) = 1 - P(S) = 0.88.\n\nWe can express the overall probability of lung cancer as:\n\nP(LC) = P(LC|S) * P(S) + P(LC|NS) * P(NS)\n\nSub",
