The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 78%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 32%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is essentially asking whether the probability of a ringing alarm given that the husband set the alarm (P(ringing alarm | set alarm)) is higher than the probability of a ringing alarm given that the husband did not set the alarm (P(ringing alarm | not set alarm)).\n\nTo compare these probabilities, we need to consider the counterfactual: what would happen if the husband had not set the alarm, but we are still considering the scenario where the husband set the alarm. This is a classic example of a counterfactual question in causal inference.\n\nThe key insight here is that the probability of a ringing alarm given that the husband set the alarm (P(ringing alarm | set alarm)) is 32%, and the probability of a ringing alarm given that the husband did not set the alarm (P(ringing alarm | not set alarm)) is 78%. Since 78% is greater than 32%, it would actually be more likely to see a ringing alarm if",
