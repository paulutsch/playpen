The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In other words, we want to compare P(L|E=1) and P(L|E=0) given that E=1.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of S (smoking). Since S is unobserved, we cannot directly control for it. However, we can use the backdoor criterion to identify the causal effect.\n\nThe backdoor path from E to L is E -> D -> L. We can use the formula for the backdoor criterion to estimate the causal effect:\n\nP(L|E=1) = P(L|E=0) + [P(D|E=1) - P(D|E=0)] \\* P(L|D)\n\n",
