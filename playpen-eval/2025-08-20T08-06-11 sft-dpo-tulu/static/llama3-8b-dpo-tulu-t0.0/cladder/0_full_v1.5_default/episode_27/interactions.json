The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 15%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 54%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 4%. Is the chance of intelligent child smaller when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

P has a direct effect on S and C.\n2. Other unobserved factors (let's call it U) has a direct effect on S and C.\n3. S has a direct effect on C.\n4. P ~ 0.15 (probability of intelligent parents)\n5. PÌ„C ~ 0.54 (probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child)\n6. PC ~ 0.04 (probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child)\n\nWe want to know if the chance of intelligent child (C) is smaller when observing intelligent parents (P). This is equivalent to asking whether the conditional probability P(C|P) is smaller than the unconditional probability P(C).\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the effect of the confounding variable U. Since U has a direct effect on both S and C, it can create a spurious relationship between P and C. Specifically, if U is positively correlated with P and C, then the observed association between P and C may be due to the",
