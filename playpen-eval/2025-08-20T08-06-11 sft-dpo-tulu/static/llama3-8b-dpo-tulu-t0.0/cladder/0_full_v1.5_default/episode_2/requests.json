Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the variables:\n\n- F: CEO's decision to fire the employee\n- M: Manager's decision to sign the termination letter\n- E: Employee's being fired\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(E|F=1, M=0) = 24% (CEO fires, Manager doesn't sign)\n- P(E|F=1, M=1) = 60% (CEO fires, Manager signs)\n- P(E|F=0, M=0) = 39% (CEO doesn't fire, Manager doesn't sign)\n- P(E|F=0, M=1) = 74% (CEO doesn't fire, Manager signs)\n- P(F) = 18% (overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee)\n\nWe want to estimate the effect of M on E, controlling for F. To do this, we can use the formula for the total effect of M on E:\n\nP(E|M=1) - P(E|M=0) = [P(E|F=1, M=1) * P(F|F=1, M=1) + P(E|F=0, M=1) * P(F|F=0, M=1)] - [P",
