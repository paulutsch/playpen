The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

P(S = Rainy) = 0.87\n2. P(G = Wet | S = Dry) = 0.07\n3. P(G = Wet | S = Rainy) = 0.5\n\nWe want to determine if the chance of wet ground (G = Wet) is larger when observing a rainy season (S = Rainy). To do this, we need to compare the conditional probability of G = Wet given S = Rainy to the unconditional probability of G = Wet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the unconditional probability of G = Wet:\n\nP(G = Wet) = P(G = Wet | S = Dry) * P(S = Dry) + P(G = Wet | S = Rainy) * P(S = Rainy)\n= 0.07 * (1 - 0.87) + 0.5 * 0.87\n= 0.07 * 0.13 + 0.435\n= 0.0091 + 0.435\n= 0.4441\n\nNow, let's calculate the conditional probability of G =",
