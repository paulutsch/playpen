	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, let's break down the given information and apply the principles of causal inference. We have the following relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status.\\ \tt 2. Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status.\\ \tt 3. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status.\\ \tt 4. Residency status is unobserved.\\ \tt 5. The overall probability of male gender is 13%.\\ \tt 6. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%.\\ \tt 7. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are asked to determine whether admission acceptance is less likely than admission rejection overall. To do this, we need to consider the potential effects of the unobserved variable, residency status, on the outcome of interest, admission status.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since residency status is unobserved, we cannot directly estimate its effect on admission status. However, we can use the backdoor criterion to identify a potential confounding effect. The backdoor criterion states that a variable is a confounder if it satisfies two conditions:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. The variable is associated with the outcome (admission status).\\ \tt 2. The variable is associated with the exposure (gender and department competitiveness).\\ \tt \\ \tt Residency status satisfies both conditions: it affects department competitiveness and admission status. Therefore, it is a potential confounder.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the overall probability of admission acceptance, we need
