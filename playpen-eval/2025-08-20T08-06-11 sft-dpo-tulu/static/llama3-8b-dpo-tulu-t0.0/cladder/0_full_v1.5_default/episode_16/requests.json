Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 17%. The probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing alarm is 69%. The probability of alarm set by husband and ringing alarm is 3%.

Let's denote the event of an alarm being set by the husband as H, the event of an alarm being set by the wife as W, and the event of an alarm ringing as R.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(H) = 17% (probability of alarm set by husband)\n- P(R|H̄) = 69% (probability of alarm ringing given that it was not set by husband)\n- P(H and R) = 3% (probability of alarm set by husband and ringing)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of an alarm ringing given that it was set by the husband (P(R|H)) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(R|H) = P(R and H) / P(H)\n= 3% / 17%\n= 0.1765 (approximately 17.65%)\n\nNow, we can compare this to the probability of an alarm ringing given that it was not set by the husband (P(R|H̄)), which is 69%. Since 17.65% is less than 69%, the chance of a ringing alarm is indeed smaller when observing an alarm set by the husband.\n\nThis result is consistent with the causal relationships given in the problem.
