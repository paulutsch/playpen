Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 77%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 45%.

In this hypothetical world, we have three variables: ability to speak english (E), smoking (S), diabetes (D), and lifespan (L). The relationships between these variables are as follows:\n\n1. E → D (speaking english has a direct effect on diabetes)\n2. S → D (smoking has a direct effect on diabetes)\n3. D → L (diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan)\n\nWe are also given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(L|¬E) = 0.77 (probability of long lifespan for people who do not speak english)\n- P(L|E) = 0.45 (probability of long lifespan for people who speak english)\n\nThe question asks whether speaking english (E) decreases the chance of long lifespan (L). To answer this, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of smoking (S), which is unobserved. We can use the concept of counterfactuals to reason about this.\n\nLet's consider the following counterfactual: what would be the probability of long lifespan for people who speak english if they did not smoke? We can denote this as P(L|E, S=0). Since smoking is unobserved, we cannot directly estimate this probability. However, we can use",
