The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 75%. The probability of not yomx and xevu is 22%. The probability of yomx and xevu is 56%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. P(yomx) = 0.75\n2. P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n3. P(yomx and xevu) = 0.56\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(xevu):\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu and yomx) + P(xevu and not yomx)\n= P(yomx and xevu) + P(not yomx and xevu)\n= 0.56 + 0.22\n= 0.78\n\nNow, we need to find P(xevu|yomx). We can use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(xevu|yomx) = P(yomx and xevu) / P(yomx)\n= 0.56 / 0.75\n= 0.7467\n\nTo determine if the chance of xevu is smaller when observing yomx, we need to compare P(xevu|yomx) to P(x",
