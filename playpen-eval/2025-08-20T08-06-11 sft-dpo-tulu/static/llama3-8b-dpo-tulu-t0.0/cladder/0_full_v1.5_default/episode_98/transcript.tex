	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on wibl. Wibl has a direct effect on uvzi. We know that zuph causes not wibl, and we know that wibl causes not uvzi. Would an individual is not uvzi if zuph instead of not zuph?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt The given conditions state that Zuph has a direct effect on Wibl, Wibl has a direct effect on Uvzi, and that Zuph causes Wibl and Wibl causes Uvzi. However, it is also given that Zuph does not cause Uvzi and Wibl does not cause Uvzi. \\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether an individual is not Uvzi if Zuph instead of not Zuph, we need to consider the causal relationships between the variables. Since Zuph causes Wibl, changing Zuph from not Zuph to Zuph would lead to a change in Wibl. However, this change in Wibl does not affect Uvzi because Wibl does not cause Uvzi. Therefore, the change in Zuph would not lead to a change in Uvzi, and an individual would still be not Uvzi.
