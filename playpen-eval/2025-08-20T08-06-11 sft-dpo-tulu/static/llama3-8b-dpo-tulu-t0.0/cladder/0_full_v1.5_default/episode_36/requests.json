Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%.

Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. The probability of full moon is 16%.\n2. The probability of wet ground given no full moon is 56%.\n3. The probability of wet ground given full moon is 54%.\n\nWe are asked to compare the overall probability of wet ground to dry ground. To do this, we need to calculate the probability of wet ground and dry ground under both scenarios (with and without full moon) and then combine them using the law of total probability.\n\nLet's denote the probability of wet ground as P(W) and the probability of dry ground as P(D). We can express P(W) and P(D) as follows:\n\nP(W) = P(W|FM) \\* P(FM) + P(W|~FM) \\* P(~FM)\nP(D) = P(D|FM) \\* P(FM) + P(D|~FM) \\* P(~FM)\n\nwhere FM denotes the presence of full moon, ~FM denotes the absence of full moon, P(W|FM) is the probability of wet ground given full moon, P(W|~FM) is the probability of wet ground given no full moon, and so on.\n\nSince the only possible outcomes are wet ground (W) and dry ground (",
