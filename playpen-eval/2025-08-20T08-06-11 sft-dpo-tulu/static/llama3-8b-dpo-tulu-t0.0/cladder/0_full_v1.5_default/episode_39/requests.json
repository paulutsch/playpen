Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size.\n2. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size.\n3. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%.\n4. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%.\n5. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.\n\nWe are asked to determine whether large feet are more likely than small feet overall. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes for individuals who did and did not receive tanning salon treatment.\n\nLet's define two potential outcomes for foot size: large (L) and small (S). We can use the notation P(L|T) to denote the probability of large feet given tanning salon treatment (T), and P(L|¬T) to denote the probability of large feet given no tanning salon treatment (¬T).\n\nFrom the given information, we know that P(T) = 0.1 (10% probability of tanning salon treatment) and P(L|¬T) = 0.13 (13% probability of large feet given no tanning salon treatment). We also know that P(L|T)",
