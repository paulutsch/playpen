Appearance has a direct effect on fame.\n2. Talent has a direct effect on fame.\n3. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%.\n4. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\n5. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\n\nWe are asked to determine whether talent is more likely than lack of talent overall. To do this, we need to calculate the overall probability of talent.\n\nLet's define two events: T (talent) and A (attractive appearance). We are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\nP(T|A) = 9% (probability of talent given attractive appearance)\nP(T|~A) = 9% (probability of talent given unattractive appearance)\nP(A) = 56% (overall probability of attractive appearance)\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of talent:\n\nP(T) = P(T|A) \\* P(A) + P(T|~A) \\* P(~A)\n= 0.09 \\* 0.56 + 0.09 \\* (1 - 0.56)\n= 0.0504 + 0.",
