	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Appearance has a direct effect on fame. Talent has a direct effect on fame. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%. Is talent more likely than lack of talent overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, talent is more likely than lack of talent overall. \\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of conditional probabilities and the law of total probability. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let's break down the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Appearance has a direct effect on fame.\\ \tt 2. Talent has a direct effect on fame.\\ \tt 3. The overall probability of attractive appearance is 56%.\\ \tt 4. For people considered unattractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\\ \tt 5. For people considered attractive, the probability of talent is 9%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are asked to determine whether talent is more likely than lack of talent overall. To do this, we need to calculate the overall probability of talent.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's define two events: T (talent) and A (attractive appearance). We are given the following conditional probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(T|A) = 9% (probability of talent given attractive appearance)\\ \tt P(T|~A) = 9% (probability of talent given unattractive appearance)\\ \tt P(A) = 56% (overall probability of attractive appearance)\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of talent:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(T) = P(T|A) \* P(A) + P(T|~A) \* P(~A)\\ \tt = 0.09 \* 0.56 + 0.09 \* (1 - 0.56)\\ \tt = 0.0504 + 0.
