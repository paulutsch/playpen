The probability of arriving to school on time might be higher when Alice wakes up late because, on days when she wakes up late, traffic is more likely to be lighter, allowing her to arrive on time. This is a classic example of a confounding variable, where the association between the treatment (waking up late) and the outcome (arriving to school on time) is due to a third variable (traffic).\n\nTo establish a causal relationship, we would need to control for the effect of traffic or use a different study design, such as a randomized controlled trial, where Alice's wake-up time is randomly assigned, and traffic is not a confounding variable. \n\nIn this hypothetical world, without any additional information or control for traffic, we cannot conclude that waking up late causally increases the chance of arriving to school on time.<|eot_id|>",
