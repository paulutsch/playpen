Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission.\n2. Effort has a direct effect on college admission.\n3. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 67%.\n4. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 55%.\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of college admission for a smoker to the probability of college admission for a nonsmoker. To do this, we need to consider the effect of smoking on effort and then on college admission.\n\nLet's denote the probability of effort given smoking as P(E|S) and the probability of effort given nonsmoking as P(E|NS). We also denote the probability of college admission given effort and smoking as P(A|E,S) and the probability of college admission given effort and nonsmoking as P(A|E,NS).\n\nFrom the given information, we know that P(A|S) = 55% and P(A|NS) = 67%. We also know that effort has a direct effect on college admission, so P(A|E,S) and P(A|E,NS) are not equal to P(A|S) and P(A|NS) respectively.\n\nHowever, we can use the law of total probability to express P(A|S) and P(A|NS) in terms",
