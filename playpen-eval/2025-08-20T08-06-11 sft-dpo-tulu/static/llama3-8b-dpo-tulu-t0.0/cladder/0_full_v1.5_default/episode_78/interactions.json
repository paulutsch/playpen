The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Given that wibl has a direct effect on both vubr and zuph, and both vubr and zuph have a direct effect on uvzi, wibl can be a confounder in the relationship between zuph and uvzi.\n\nTo determine the causal effect of zuph on uvzi, we can use the backdoor criterion, which involves identifying a path from zuph to uvzi that is unconfounded. \n\nOne such path is: zuph → uvzi. However, this path is confounded by wibl. \n\nAnother path is: zuph → vubr → uvzi. This path is also confounded by wibl.\n\nTo unconfound these paths, we can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect of zuph on uvzi:\n\nP(uvzi|zuph) = P(uvzi|zuph, wibl) * P(wibl|zuph) + P(uvzi|zuph, not wibl) * P(not wibl|zuph)\n\nWe can estimate the probabilities in this formula using the given data:\n\nP(uvzi|zuph, wibl) = 76",
