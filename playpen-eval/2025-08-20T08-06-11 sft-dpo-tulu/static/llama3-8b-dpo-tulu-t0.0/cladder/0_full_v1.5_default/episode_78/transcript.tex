	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, zuph will increase the chance of uvzi. \\ \tt \\ \tt To assess the effect of zuph on uvzi, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of wibl. Given that wibl has a direct effect on both vubr and zuph, and both vubr and zuph have a direct effect on uvzi, wibl can be a confounder in the relationship between zuph and uvzi.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the causal effect of zuph on uvzi, we can use the backdoor criterion, which involves identifying a path from zuph to uvzi that is unconfounded. \\ \tt \\ \tt One such path is: zuph → uvzi. However, this path is confounded by wibl. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another path is: zuph → vubr → uvzi. This path is also confounded by wibl.\\ \tt \\ \tt To unconfound these paths, we can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect of zuph on uvzi:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(uvzi|zuph) = P(uvzi|zuph, wibl) * P(wibl|zuph) + P(uvzi|zuph, not wibl) * P(not wibl|zuph)\\ \tt \\ \tt We can estimate the probabilities in this formula using the given data:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(uvzi|zuph, wibl) = 76
