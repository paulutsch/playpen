The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect:\n\nP(Y|do(T=1)) = P(Y|T=1, U, E) = P(Y|T=1, E) = P(Y|E)\n\nSince we are interested in the probability of large feet given college degree or higher, we need to calculate P(Y|T=1). \n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate P(Y|T=1):\n\nP(Y|T=1) = P(Y|T=1, E=1) * P(T=1|E=1) + P(Y|T=1, E=0) * P(T=1|E=0)\n\nWe know that P(T=1) = 0.47, P(T=1|E=1) = 1 (since everyone with a college degree or higher",
