The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can use the following formula to estimate the causal effect:\n\nP(Y|do(T=1)) = P(Y|T=1, U, E) = P(Y|T=1, E) = P(Y|E)\n\nSince we are interested in the probability of large feet given college degree or higher, we need to calculate P(Y|T=1). \n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate P(Y|T=1):\n\nP(Y|T=1) = P(Y|T=1, E=1) * P(T=1|E=1) + P(Y|T=1, E=0) * P(T=1|E=0)\n\nWe know that P(T=1) = 0.47, P(T=1|E=1) = 1 (since everyone with a college degree or higher",
