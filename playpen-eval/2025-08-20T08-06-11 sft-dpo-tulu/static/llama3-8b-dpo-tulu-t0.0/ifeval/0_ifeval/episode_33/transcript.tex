	 Rewrite the following text so that it is funny to software engineers using notations from the book "The C Programming Language": "The use of the various constructions described in this chapter is one of the most distinctive features of the C programming language." Make this sound like it is being said by the president of the United States and capitalize every letter.

	 "My fellow AMERICANS, and all you FINE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS out there, I am pleased to declare that the use of the various CONSTRUCTIONS described in this CHAPTER, such as the IF STATEMENT (if (condition) statement;) and the WHILE LOOP (while (condition) statement;), is one of the most DISTINCTIVE FEATURES of the C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, which, as we all know, is the LANGUAGE OF CHOICE for those who dare to WRITE IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE (int main() { /*... */ return 0; }).\\ \tt \\ \tt We must CELEBRATE this feature, for it is what sets us apart from those who write in languages that are as BORING as a FOR LOOP (for (i = 0; i < n; i++) statement;). We must continue to USE THESE CONSTRUCTIONS with PRIDE, and to WRITE CODE that is as EFFICIENT as a WELL-OPTIMIZED BINARY SEARCH TREE (struct node *search(struct node *root, int key) { /*... */ }).\\ \tt \\ \tt So let us raise our flags, and our compilers, and let us PROCLAIM to the world that we are the LAND OF THE FREE, and the HOME OF THE BRAVE, and the LAND OF THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!"
