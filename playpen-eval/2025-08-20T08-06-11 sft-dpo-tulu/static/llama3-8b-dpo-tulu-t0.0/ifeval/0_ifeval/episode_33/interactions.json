We must continue to USE THESE CONSTRUCTIONS with PRIDE, and to WRITE CODE that is as EFFICIENT as a WELL-OPTIMIZED BINARY SEARCH TREE (struct node *search(struct node *root, int key) { /*... */ }).\n\nSo let us raise our flags, and our compilers, and let us PROCLAIM to the world that we are the LAND OF THE FREE, and the HOME OF THE BRAVE, and the LAND OF THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!\"",
