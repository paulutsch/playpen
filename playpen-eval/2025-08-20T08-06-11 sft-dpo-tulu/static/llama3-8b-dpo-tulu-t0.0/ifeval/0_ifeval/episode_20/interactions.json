Open the toilet tank to drain the water and let it sit for a few minutes to ensure the water has stopped flowing.\n\n***\nStep 2: **Disconnect the water supply line**: Use an adjustable wrench to loosen the nut that holds the water supply line to the toilet. Once loose, use a wrench to completely remove the nut and the supply line from the toilet.\n\n***\nStep 3: **Disconnect the toilet from the floor**: Use a wrench to loosen the nuts that hold the toilet to the floor. You may need to use a putty knife to break the old wax ring that holds the toilet in place. Once the nuts are loose, carefully lift the toilet off the floor.\n\n***\nStep 4: **Remove the old wax ring and debris**: Use a putty knife or a scraper to remove the old wax ring and any debris that may be stuck to the floor. This will ensure a clean surface for the new wax ring.\n\n***\nStep 5: **Inspect and prepare the flange**: Inspect the toilet flange (the metal ring that holds the toilet in place) for any damage or mineral buildup. Clean the flange with a wire brush and apply a new wax ring to the flange, making sure it's centered and evenly spread.\n\nLet me know how it works. I can give you next steps when you finish all steps above.",
