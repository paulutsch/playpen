	 **My Worst Nightmare: Being Followed by a Stranger**\\ \tt \\ \tt I was walking home from school yesterday when I noticed a guy following me. At first I thought it was just my imagination but as I kept looking back I saw him. He was always a few feet behind me but never close enough to talk to. I quickened my pace but he kept up. I started to feel really scared and anxious. I tried to call my mom but my phone was dead. I finally made it home and ran inside locking the door behind me. I'm still shaken by the experience and I don't know what to do.
