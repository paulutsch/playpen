After checking into their accommodations, they will participate in a series of trust-building exercises, including a group hug and a round of \"Simon Says\" with a twist (Simon will be wearing a pair of oversized novelty sunglasses). The day will culminate in a massive pizza party, where the students will be forced to eat an entire pie by themselves in under 10 minutes.\n\n*** \n\n**Day 2: Beach Day and Extreme Sports**\n\nThe students will spend the day at the beach, where they will engage in a series of extreme sports, including surfing, paddleboarding, and sand-sculpture building. However, things will take a turn for the absurd when the students are challenged to a sand-digging contest, where the winner will receive a year's supply of sunscreen. The day will also feature a series of hilarious beach-themed games, including \"Beach Volleyball\" (played with a giant inflatable beach ball) and \"Sand-Sculpture Scavenger Hunt\" (where the students will have to find and identify various sand-sculpture creations).\n\n*** \n\n**Day 3: Cultural Immersion and Karaoke**\n\nThe students will spend the day immersed in local culture, where they will learn how to make traditional beach-themed crafts, including seashell wind chimes and beach-themed jewelry. However, things will take a turn for the ridiculous when the students are challenged to a karaoke competition, where they will have to sing their favorite beach-themed songs (including \"Kokomo\" and \"Surfin' U.S.A.\"). The day will culminate in a massive beach-themed dance party, where the students will be forced to wear oversized sunglasses and beach-themed costumes.\n\n*** \n\n**Day 4: Departure and Goodbyes**\n\nThe students will spend the morning saying goodbye to their new friends and reflecting on the absurdity of the past three days. They will then depart for home, where they will be greeted with a surprise party and a year's supply of sunscreen. The students will leave with memories of their hilarious adventure and a newfound appreciation for the absurdity of life.",
