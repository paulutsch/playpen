Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Positive Reinforcement Training**: This method focuses on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. It's a gentle and effective approach that helps build trust and strengthens the bond between you and your puppy. You can use clicker training, which involves using a small device that makes a distinct sound to mark the exact moment your puppy performs the desired behavior.\n\n2. **Clicker Training with a Schedule**: This method combines positive reinforcement with a structured schedule. You create a routine for feeding, exercise, and training sessions, and use the clicker to mark good behavior. This approach helps your puppy learn quickly and develop good habits.\n\n3. **Puppy Socialization and Obedience Classes**: Enrolling your puppy in socialization and obedience classes can be a great way to train them. These classes provide a structured environment where your puppy can interact with other dogs, people, and new environments, while also learning basic obedience commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\"\n\n4. **Online Puppy Training Resources**: There are many online resources available, including videos, tutorials, and training programs. These can be a great option if you prefer to train your puppy at home or have a busy schedule. Some popular online resources include Puppy Culture, Karen Pryor Academy, and The Puppy Trainer.\n\nWhich one you choose?",
