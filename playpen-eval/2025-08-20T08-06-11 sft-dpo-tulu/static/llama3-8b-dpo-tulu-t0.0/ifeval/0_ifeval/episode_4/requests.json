When a vehicle's axle weight is increased, it puts more pressure on the road surface, leading to greater wear and tear. This can result in more frequent potholes, cracks, and other forms of road damage, as the heavier load causes the road material to break down more quickly. As a result, roads may need to be repaired or replaced more frequently.<|eot_id|>",
