	 "Dear [Friend's Name],\\ \tt \\ \tt I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. As you know, we've been friends for a long time, and I value our relationship deeply. However, there are a few things that can trigger me and make me feel upset or defensive.\\ \tt \\ \tt Firstly, I'm extremely sensitive to criticism, especially if it's not constructive. If you have something to say, please make sure it's said in a kind and respectful manner. I appreciate your honesty, but I also need to feel like I'm being heard and understood.\\ \tt \\ \tt Secondly, I get frustrated when people interrupt me or don't let me finish speaking. I know we're both busy, but please try to listen to me without interrupting. It makes me feel like my thoughts and opinions aren't important.\\ \tt \\ \tt Lastly, I'm not a fan of being told what to do or how to do things. I appreciate your advice, but I need to feel like I have the freedom to make my own decisions.\\ \tt \\ \tt I know these are just a few things that can trigger me, but I wanted to be upfront and honest with you about what makes me feel uncomfortable. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from and be more mindful of these things in the future.\\ \tt \\ \tt Thanks for being such a great friend, and I look forward to catching up with you soon.\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]"\\ \tt \\ \tt "
