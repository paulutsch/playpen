	 Subject: You have to listen to 'Lilith' by Lana Del Rey\\ \tt \\ \tt Dear Luheng,\\ \tt \\ \tt I've been listening to a lot of music lately, and I stumbled upon an album that I think you'll really enjoy. It's called 'Lilith' by Lana Del Rey, and it's a beautiful, atmospheric collection of songs that explore themes of love, loss, and nostalgia. The album has a dreamy, ethereal quality to it that I think you'll find really captivating.\\ \tt \\ \tt Lana Del Rey's voice is hauntingly beautiful, and she has a way of conveying emotion through her lyrics that's really powerful. The album features a mix of slow, introspective tracks and more upbeat, atmospheric songs that showcase her range as a singer and songwriter.\\ \tt \\ \tt I think you'll really appreciate the moody, cinematic soundscapes that Lana Del Rey creates on this album. It's the perfect music to listen to when you're feeling introspective or just want to get lost in a world of sound.\\ \tt \\ \tt Give it a listen and let me know what you think!\\ \tt \\ \tt Best,\\ \tt [Your Name]\\ \tt \\ \tt P.S. I've included a link to the album on Spotify below, so you can give it a listen right away. [insert link]
