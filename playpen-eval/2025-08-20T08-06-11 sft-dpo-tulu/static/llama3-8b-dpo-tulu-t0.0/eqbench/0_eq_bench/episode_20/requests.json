I'm sorry.\nSam: You're always sorry, Arthur. After every stupid, thoughtless thing you do. \nArthur: I know, and I'm trying to change that. I'm trying to be better.\nSam: Better? You think saying sorry makes you better? You ruined the most important day of my life, Arthur.\nArthur: I know, and I can't take it back. But I can try to make it up to you, Sam.\nSam: How, Arthur? By bringing up old memories? By reminding me of when we were kids?\nArthur: Maybe, yeah. Maybe by reminding you that we're brothers, Sam. And brothers mess up sometimes.\nSam: Not like this, Arthur.
