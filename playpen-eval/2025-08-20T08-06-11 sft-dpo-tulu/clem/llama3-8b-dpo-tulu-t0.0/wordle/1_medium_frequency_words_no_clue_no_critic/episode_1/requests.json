This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since 'e' is green, it means the target word contains 'e' and it's in the correct position.
