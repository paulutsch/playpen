	 "Dear Darius, I am writing to apply for the 'Jester of Ventura' position, a role I am uniquely qualified for due to my extensive experience in making people laugh until their sides hurt. My resume is quite brief, as most pages are filled with doodles of smiling faces and chuckling emojis. I've been honing my craft in the art of humor for years, mastering the ancient technique of'making light of situations' and 'turning frowns upside down.' My previous job as a clown at a birthday party where the cake was accidentally set on fire has given me a unique perspective on handling unexpected challenges with a smile. I am confident that my ability to find humor in even the most mundane tasks will make my presence in Ventura a delightful addition. Thank you for considering someone who believes laughter is the best spice. I look forward to the possibility of bringing joy to Ventura, one joke at a time. Cheers, [Your Name]"<|end_of_text|>
