	 Rewrite the following text so that it is funny to software engineers using notations from the book "The C Programming Language": "The use of the various constructions described in this chapter is one of the most distinctive features of the C programming language." Make this sound like it is being said by the president of the United States and capitalize every letter.

	 FELLOW SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, AS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE C LANGUAGE, I AM HERE TO PROCLAIM THAT THE EMPLOYMENT OF VARIOUS CONSTRUCTS, AS OUTLINED IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OF "THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE," IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF OUR GREAT C PROGRAMMING NATION. FROM THE FOR LOOPS TO THE SWITCH STATEMENTS, THESE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR DIGITAL EMPIRE. LET US HONOR THESE PRECIOUS TOKENS AND OPERATORS, FOR THEY ARE THE KEYS TO UNLOCKING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ALLIES. LONG LIVE THE C LANGUAGE, AND MAY ITS SYNTAX ALWAYS RUN SMOOTHLY AND ERROR-FREE. GOD BLESS AMERICA, AND GOD BLESS THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.<|end_of_text|>
