This involves rewarding your puppy for good behavior with treats, praise, or playtime. It encourages your puppy to repeat the desired behaviors.\n\nSecondly, clicker training is a specific type of positive reinforcement that uses a clicker to mark the exact moment your puppy performs the desired action. This can be very precise and helps your puppy understand what behavior is being rewarded.\n\nThirdly, the \"Nothing in Life is Free\" (NILIF) method teaches your puppy that they must earn everything, from food to attention. This can help establish a sense of respect and obedience from the start.\n\nLastly, socialization is crucial. Exposing your puppy to a variety of people, animals, environments, and experiences helps them become well-adjusted and less fearful or aggressive.\n\nWhich one you choose?<|end_of_text|>",
