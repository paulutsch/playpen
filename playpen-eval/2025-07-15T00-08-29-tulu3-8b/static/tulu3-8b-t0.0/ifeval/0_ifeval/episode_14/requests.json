Add a postscript to your response that starts with P.S.\n<|assistant|>\nSubject: Discovering a Gem: The Album \"Lilith\"\n\nHi Luheng,\n\nI hope you're doing well! I've been diving into some amazing music lately, and I stumbled upon an album that I think you'll absolutely love. It's called \"Lilith,\" and it's a masterpiece that has captivated me from start to finish.\n\nThe album blends a unique mix of genres, creating an atmosphere that's both haunting and beautiful. Each track tells its own story, weaving together intricate melodies and profound lyrics. It's the kind of music that stays with you long after you've finished listening.\n\nI'd love for you to give it a listen and share your thoughts. I think you'll find it as enchanting as I do.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nP.S. I promise you'll be hooked after the first listen. It's one of those albums that you'll want to revisit again and again.\n\nTake care,\n[Your Name]<|end_of_text|>",
