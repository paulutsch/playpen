Your entire response should have exactly 4 paragraphs.  Separate paragraphs with the markdown divider: ***\n<|assistant|>\nThe adventure begins on the first day with a grand entrance. The students will embark on a quest for the world's largest donut, a mythical creature rumored to reside in a quaint little shop just outside town. After conquering this sugary beast, they will partake in a donut-eating contest, where the champion will earn the title of \"Supreme Glaze Master.\" To burn off those calories, they'll head to the park for a spontaneous donut dodgeball game, where the donuts themselves become the unpredictable projectiles. ***  \n\nOn the second day, the students will awaken to the sound of a mysterious whistle, signaling the start of their next escapade: the Great Sand Sculpture Challenge. Armed with buckets and shovels, they will transform the beach into a wonderland of whimsical creations. The masterpieces must be both hilarious and impressive, with prizes for categories like \"Most Likely to Make a Seagull Laugh\" and \"Best Use of a Plastic Spoon.\" Post-sculpting, they will engage in a sandcastle relay race, where teamwork and speed are key, and the losers must perform an impromptu sand-tastic dance. ***  \n\nDay three promises an adventure of a different kind: the Ultimate Comedic Talent Show. Each student will prepare a five-minute act, ranging from stand-up comedy to interpretive dance about laundry day. The evening will be filled with laughter, as friends become both judges and audience, ensuring an unbiased yet enthusiastic support. The grand finale will be a group performance involving a surprise prop and a choreographed routine set to the world's most confusing song. The night will end with a bonfire, where stories of the weekend's antics are shared, and s'mores are the only currency. ***  \n\nAs the weekend draws to a close, the students will reflect on their hilarious journey, already planning the next outrageous adventure. They'll depart with hearts full of laughter and bellies full of donut memories, knowing they've created stories that will echo through the halls for years to come. This trip wasn't just about the destination; it was a comedic odyssey that bonded them in ways only shared experiences can. With promises to never forget the sand, the sugar, and the sheer absurdity of it all, they wave goodbye, already plotting their next misadventure.<|end_of_text|>",
