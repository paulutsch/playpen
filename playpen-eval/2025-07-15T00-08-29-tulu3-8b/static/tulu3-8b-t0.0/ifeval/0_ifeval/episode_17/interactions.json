Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x + (20 - x) = 32.  \nStep 6: Simplify the equation: 3x + 20 - x = 32.  \nStep 7: Combine like terms: 2x + 20 = 32.  \nStep 8: Subtract 20 from both sides: 2x = 12.  \nStep 9: Divide both sides by 2: x = 6.  \nStep 10: Therefore, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 6.  \nThe final answer is '6'.\"<|end_of_text|>",
