Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.\n<|assistant|>\n\"Step 1: Let's denote the number of family members who have 3 pets as x.  \nStep 2: Each of these x members has 3 pets, so the total number of pets from these members is 3x.  \nStep 3: The remaining members have at least one pet, and let's denote the number of such members as (20 - x).  \nStep 4: Each of these (20 - x) members has at least 1 pet, so the minimum number of pets they could have is (20 - x).  \nStep 5: The total number of pets is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x + (20 - x) = 32.  \nStep 6: Simplify the equation: 3x + 20 - x = 32.  \nStep 7: Combine like terms: 2x + 20 = 32.  \nStep 8: Subtract 20 from both sides: 2x = 12.  \nStep 9: Divide both sides by 2: x = 6.  \nStep 10: Therefore, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 6.  \nThe final answer is '6'.\"<|end_of_text|>",
