Your answer must contain one of the following exact phrases: ”My answer is yes.\", \"My answer is no.\", \"My answer is maybe.\"\n<|assistant|>\nMy answer is maybe. Given that a + b = 10 and a > b, we know that a must be greater than b. However, we do not have enough information to definitively say that a must be exactly 6. While a could be 6 (if b were 4), there are other possible values for a and b that satisfy the given conditions (for example, a could be 7 and b could be 3). Therefore, without additional constraints, we cannot conclusively state that a is indeed 6.<|end_of_text|>",
