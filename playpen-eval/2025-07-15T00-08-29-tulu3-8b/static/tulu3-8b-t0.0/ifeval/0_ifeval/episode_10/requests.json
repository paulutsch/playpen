Task Summary\n***  \nThe task involves optimizing the performance of the company's web application. The current application experiences slow load times and high CPU usage, particularly during peak usage hours. The goal is to enhance the user experience by reducing load times and ensuring a smoother operation.\n\nPart 2. Motivation\n***  \nThe current performance issues are affecting user satisfaction and potentially leading to lost business opportunities. Optimizing the application will not only improve user experience but also reduce operational costs by minimizing server resources usage. Additionally, a more efficient application will be better positioned to handle future growth and increased user traffic.\n\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n***  \n- **Milestone 1:** Conduct a thorough performance analysis of the application, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n- **Milestone 2:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.\n- **Milestone 3:** Optimize the application's codebase, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and removing unnecessary computations.\n- **Milestone 4:** Test the optimized application under load to ensure performance improvements are maintained and functional requirements are met.\n- **Milestone 5:** Deploy the optimized application and monitor performance for at least two weeks post-deployment to ensure stability and continued improvement.\n\nPart 4. Timeline\n***  \n- **Week 1:** Conduct performance analysis and define optimization strategies (Milestone 1).\n- **Week 2-3:** Implement caching and optimize codebase (Milestones 2 and 3).\n- **Week 4:** Conduct load testing and make necessary adjustments (Milestone 4).\n- **Week 5:** Deploy optimized application and begin monitoring (Milestone 5).\n- **Week 6-8:** Continuously monitor performance and address any issues that arise.\n\nPart 5. Doc history\n***  \n- **Version 1.0:** Initial planning document created on [Date].\n- **Version 1.1:** Updated timeline and added detailed milestones on [Date].\n- **Version 1.2:** Adjusted Milestone 3 focus to include specific areas of code optimization on [Date].\n- **Version 1.3:** Added monitoring period post-deployment on [Date].<|end_of_text|>",
