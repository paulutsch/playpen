Separated the stanzas using 3 asterisk markers: ***\n<|assistant|>\n*  \nIn a land where the sun always shines,  \nThere's a product so cool and so fine.  \nIt's a magical, squishy balloon,  \nThat floats up high and won't pop soon.  \n\n***  \n\nThis balloon, oh so wondrous and bright,  \nComes in colors that light up the night.  \nYou can blow it up with a mighty gust,  \nOr a gentle puff, it's your choice, just trust!  \n\n***  \n\nIt sings songs when the wind starts to blow,  \nAnd dances a jig in the sky, you know.  \nKids chase it around with big, wide grins,  \nWhile parents watch, with a knowing grin.  \n\n***  \n\nBut wait! There's more! It glows in the dark,  \nA nighttime wonder, a star in the park.  \nIt's the perfect gift for your best friend,  \nOr a treat for yourself, no need to pretend.  \n\n***  \n\nSo hurry and buy, don't delay,  \nThis balloon will make your day.  \nIt's the best thing you'll ever own,  \nPromise, it's true, we won't make a phone!  \n\n***  \n\nJust imagine the fun you'll have,  \nWith this balloon, oh so brave.  \nIt's a friend that won't let you down,  \nIn the sky or on the ground!  <|end_of_text|>",
