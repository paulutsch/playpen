First, the European Central Bank must critically reassess its own projections, ensuring they are grounded in a realistic assessment rather than an optimistic bias. Second, the ECB must remain steadfast in its commitment to economic stability, resisting any undue pressure from those who may seek to exaggerate the threat of inflation. In this endeavor, we must approach our decisions with the same careful consideration one might apply when writing their memoirs, ensuring that every stroke of the pen, much like every policy decision, is deliberate and informed.<|end_of_text|>",
