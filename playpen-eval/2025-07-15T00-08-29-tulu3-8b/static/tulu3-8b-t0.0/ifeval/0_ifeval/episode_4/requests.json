Your response must contain a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>. Use less than 5 sentences.\n<|assistant|>\n<<Impact of Axle Weight on Road Damage>>\n\nIncreased axle weight can lead to more significant damage to roads due to the greater stress and wear it imposes on the pavement. This additional strain can accelerate the deterioration of the road surface, requiring more frequent maintenance and repairs. Heavier loads compact the roadbed, reducing its lifespan and increasing long-term costs for infrastructure upkeep. As a result, regulations often limit the maximum allowable axle weight to mitigate such damage.<|end_of_text|>",
