However, the term \"clever\" might be slightly ambiguous, as it can imply not only intelligence but also being resourceful or astute. To avoid this ambiguity and stick strictly to the meaning of \"not very smart,\" a more precise term could be \"intelligent,\" but this is not commonly used in everyday language to describe someone's lack of intelligence. A more colloquial and direct way to say \"not very smart\" in German might be \"aber nicht sehr begabt\" or \"aber nicht sehr geistig begabt.\" These alternatives are more straightforward and convey the intended meaning more precisely. Nonetheless, the original translation is perfectly understandable and would be widely accepted in everyday conversation.<|end_of_text|>",
