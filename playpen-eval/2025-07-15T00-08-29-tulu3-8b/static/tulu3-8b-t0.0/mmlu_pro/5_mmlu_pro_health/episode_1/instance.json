  "input": "Question:\nWater transport can occur from the lumen of the intestine to the blood stream, or from the blood stream to the intestinal lumen. Which single statement about this phenomenon, below, is actually correct?\n\nOptions:\nA. Dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine\nB. Water flows into the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality\nC. Water flows out of the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to increase luminal osmolality\nD. Water is primarily transported by movement within the cells lining the gut (enterocytes)\nE. Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions\nF. Water transport from the blood stream to the intestinal lumen only occurs during digestion\nG. Water transport from the intestine to the blood stream does not occur during digestion\nH. A \"flip-flop\" mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane\nI. Water is mostly absorbed by the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via osmosis\nJ. Water movement in the small intestine is always lesser than dietary intake of water\n",
