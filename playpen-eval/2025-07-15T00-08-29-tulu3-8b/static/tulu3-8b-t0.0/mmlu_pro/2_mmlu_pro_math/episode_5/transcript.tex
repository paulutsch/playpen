A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute.

There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.\\ \tt B. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.\\ \tt C. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.\\ \tt D. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.\\ \tt E. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.\\ \tt F.

N/A\\ \tt The answer is (B)\\ \tt \\ \tt Question:\\ \tt A farmer wants to know whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples. With the old fertilizer, the mean weight was 4.0 ounces per apple. The farmer decides to test H0: μ = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : μ > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where μ = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?\\ \tt Options:\\ \tt A. P(Z > 2)\\ \tt B. P(Z < 2)\\ \tt C. P(Z > 2) with 16 degrees of freedom\\ \tt D. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\\ \tt E. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\\ \tt F. P(Z < 1.5)\\ \tt G. P(Z > 1.5)\\ \tt H. P(t > 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom\\ \tt I. P(t < 2) with 16 degrees of freedom\\ \tt J. P(t < 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom\\ \tt

	 The answer is (A)\\ \tt \\ \tt Explanation:\\ \tt To determine the p-value for this hypothesis test, we start by standardizing the sample mean using the z-score formula:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \]\\ \tt \\ \tt Where:\\ \tt - \(\bar{x} = 4.3\) (sample mean)\\ \tt - \(\mu_0 = 4.0\) (hypothesized population mean)\\ \tt - \(\sigma = 0.6\) (sample standard deviation)\\ \tt - \(n = 16\) (sample size)\\ \tt \\ \tt Plugging in the values:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ z = \frac{4.3 - 4.0}{0.6 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{0.3}{0.6 / 4} = \frac{0.3}{0.15} = 2 \]\\ \tt \\ \tt The null hypothesis \(H_0\) states that the mean weight \(\mu\) is 4.0 ounces. We are testing against the alternative hypothesis \(H_a\) that \(\mu > 4.0\) ounces. Therefore, we need the p-value corresponding to \(P(Z > 2)\) because we are interested in the probability that the z-score is greater than 2 under the null hypothesis.\\ \tt \\ \tt Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, \(P(Z > 2)\) corresponds to the area to the right of \(z = 2\) in the standard
