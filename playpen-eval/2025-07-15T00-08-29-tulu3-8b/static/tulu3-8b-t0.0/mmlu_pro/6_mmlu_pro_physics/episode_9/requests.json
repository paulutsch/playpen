Answer only with \"The answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.\n\nQuestion:\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nOptions:\nA. 1000 times more\nB. 50 times more\nC. 5000 times more\nD. 500 times more\nE. 10000 times more\nF. 20000 times more\nG. 2000 times more\nH. 100 times more\nI. 10 times more\nJ. N/A\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nOptions:\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nE.

N/A\nThe answer is (A)\n\nQuestion:\nA refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\nOptions:\nA. 10\nB. 40\nC. 6\nD. 25\nE. 15\nF. 50\nG. 30\nH. 4\nI. 5\nJ. 20\nThe answer is (H)\n\nQuestion:\nColors in a soap bubble result from light\nOptions:\nA. dispersion\nB. deflection\nC. refraction\nD. reflection\nE. interference\nF. converted to a different frequency\nG. polarization\nH. absorption\nI. diffraction\nJ. transmission\nThe answer is (E)\n\nQuestion:\nA microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nOptions:\nA. 240 W\nB. 120 W\nC. 10 W\nD. 480 W\nE. 360 W\nF. 200 W\nG. 30 W\nH. 150 W\nI. 60 W\nJ. 300 W\nThe answer is (A)\n\nQuestion:\nA lens is used to project the image of a lantern slide on a screen located 160 ft from the projector. In this position the image on the screen is 100 times larger than the slide. If the screen is moved 100 inches closer, how far must the lantern slide be moved (relative to the lens) to keep the image on the screen in sharp focus?\nOptions:\nA. 0.01 inches\nB. 0.25 inches\nC. 1.00 inch\nD. 0.02 inches\nE. 0.40 inches\nF. 0.15 inches\nG. 0.30 inches\nH. 0.10 inches\nI. 0.75 inches\nJ. 0.05 inches\n\n<|assistant|>\n",
