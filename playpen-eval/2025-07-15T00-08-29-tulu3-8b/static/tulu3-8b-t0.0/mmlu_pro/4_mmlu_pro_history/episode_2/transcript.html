        <p>The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about history. Answer only with &quot;The answer is (X)&quot; where X is the correct letter choice.<br/><br/>Question:<br/>This question refers to the following information.<br/>In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&amp;…<br/>&quot;Foolery! They&#x27;ll never get out of it with their foolery.&quot;<br/>Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.<br/>His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:<br/>&quot;Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven&#x27;t got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.&quot;<br/>émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885<br/>The passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?<br/>Options:<br/>A. Communist<br/>B. Anarchist<br/>C. Feminist<br/>D. Fascist<br/>E. Imperialist<br/>F. Nationalist<br/>G. Enlightenment<br/>H. Existentialist<br/>I. N/A<br/>J. N/A<br/>The answer is (A)<br/><br/>Question:<br/>This question refers to the following information.<br/>The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.<br/>You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.<br/>The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.<br/>The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.<br/>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.<br/>I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.<br/>I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.<br/>All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.<br/>I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.<br/>—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795<br/>Which of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?<br/>Options:<br/>A. Thomas Hobbes<br/>B. Jean Jacques Rousseau<br/>C. Baron Montesquieu<br/>D. Voltaire<br/>E. Denis Diderot<br/>F. Immanuel Kant<br/>G. David Hume<br/>H. Mary Wollstonecraft<br/>I. Adam Smith<br/>J. John Locke<br/>The answer is (C)<br/><br/>Question:<br/>This question refers to the following information.<br/>&quot;The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.<br/>Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.&quot;<br/>Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965<br/>Which of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah&#x27;s writings?<br/>Options:<br/>A. The spread of communism<br/>B. The Industrial Revolution<br/>C. The French Revolution<br/>D. The Cold War<br/>E. Decolonization<br/>F. World War II<br/>G. Autarky<br/>H. The rise of multinational corporations<br/>I. The American Civil Rights Movement<br/>J. Regional Free Trade Associations<br/>The answer is (E)<br/><br/>Question:<br/>What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?<br/>Options:<br/>A. 1200 cc<br/>B. under 650 cc<br/>C. 1700 cc<br/>D. 1350 cc<br/>E. just under 1000 cc<br/>F. 1500 cc<br/>G. under 500 cc<br/>H. about 800 cc<br/>I. just over 1100 cc<br/>J. about 900 cc<br/>The answer is (E)<br/><br/>Question:<br/>Recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene indicates there was (as of 2020):<br/>Options:<br/>A. multiple hominid species but with limited diversity.<br/>B. a single species with no diversity.<br/>C. decreased species diversity but increased numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating stone tool manufacture.<br/>D. a single dominant species that outcompeted all others, leading to decreased diversity.<br/>E. increased species diversity due to a prolonged ice age followed by a severe drought.<br/>F. decreased species diversity due to a prolonged ice age followed by a severe drought.<br/>G. a great amount of species diversity, or a single species that exhibited a lot of diversity.<br/>H. increased species diversity but with decreased population numbers due to harsh climate conditions.<br/>I. increased species diversity but decreased numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating less stone tool manufacture.<br/>J. very little species diversity during this period and very few hominids.<br/>The answer is (G)<br/><br/>Question:<br/>According to one theory, the power of Ancestral Pueblo elites emerged when certain groups:<br/>Options:<br/>A. created intricate pottery and jewelry.<br/>B. discovered the use of fire.<br/>C. invented the wheel.<br/>D. stored food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years.<br/>E. established trade routes with distant cultures.<br/>F. constructed monuments and elaborate multi-storied cliff dwellings.<br/>G. introduced advanced farming techniques.<br/>H. predicted astronomical events such as eclipses and meteor showers.<br/>I. incorporated other societies through conquest warfare.<br/>J. developed a written language.<br/></p>
