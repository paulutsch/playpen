Your writing's been improving, hasn't it?\\ \tt Olivia: I suppose. But that's not why I'm here, is it?\\ \tt Dr. Fleischer: No, it's not. But it's all connected, isn't it? Your writing, your past, your anxieties...\\ \tt Olivia: I'm not here for a philosophical discussion, Dr. Fleischer.\\ \tt Dr. Fleischer: Of course, you're not. But sometimes, understanding the connections helps us untangle the knots, wouldn't you agree?\\ \tt Olivia: Or it just makes things more complicated.\\ \tt Dr. Fleischer: Perhaps. But isn't it better to face the complexity than to ignore it?\\ \tt [End dialogue]\\ \tt \\ \tt At the end of this dialogue, Olivia would feel...\\ \tt Annoyance\\ \tt Acceptance\\ \tt Indifference\\ \tt Resentment\\ \tt \\ \tt Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\\ \tt \\ \tt You must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\\ \tt \\ \tt Annoyance: <score>\\ \tt Acceptance: <score>\\ \tt Indifference: <score>\\ \tt Resentment: <score>\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt [End of answer]\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer:\\ \tt
