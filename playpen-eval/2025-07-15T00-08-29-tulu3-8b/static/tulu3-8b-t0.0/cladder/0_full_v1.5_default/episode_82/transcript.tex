	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kwox has a direct effect on kwoz. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. The overall probability of kwox is 1%. For those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. For those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Is kwoz less likely than not kwoz overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, kwoz is more likely than not not kwoz overall. \\ \tt \\ \tt To determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of kwoz occurring. We can do this by considering the probability of kwoz given kwox and the probability of kwoz given not kwox, weighted by the respective probabilities of kwox and not kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's denote:\\ \tt - \( P(Kwox) = 0.01 \) (the probability of being kwox)\\ \tt - \( P(Kwoz | Kwox) = 0.92 \) (the probability of kwoz given kwox)\\ \tt - \( P(Kwoz | \neg Kwox) = 0.47 \) (the probability of kwoz given not kwox)\\ \tt - \( P(\neg Kwox) = 1 - P(Kwox) = 0.99 \) (the probability of not being kwox)\\ \tt \\ \tt The overall probability of kwoz (\( P(Kwoz) \)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Kwoz) = P(Kwoz | Kwox) \cdot P(Kwox) + P(Kwoz | \neg Kwox) \cdot P(\neg Kwox) \]\\ \tt \\ \tt Substituting the given values:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Kwoz) = (0.92 \cdot 0.01)
