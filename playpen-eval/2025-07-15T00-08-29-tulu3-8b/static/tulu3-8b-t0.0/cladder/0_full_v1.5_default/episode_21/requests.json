Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, arriving to school on time is not more likely than arriving to school late overall. \n\nTo determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of Alice arriving to school on time versus arriving late. We can do this by considering the probabilities given:\n\n1. **Probability of waking up on time:** 95% (since the probability of waking up late is 5%).\n\n2. **Probability of arriving on time given waking up on time:** 52%.\n\n3. **Probability of arriving on time given waking up late:** 87%.\n\nThe overall probability of arriving on time can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = P(\\text{On Time} \\mid \\text{On Time}) \\times P(\\text{On Time}) + P(\\text{On Time} \\mid \\text{Late}) \\times P(\\text{Late}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = (0.52 \\times 0.95) + (0.87 \\times 0.05) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = (0.494) + (0.0435) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{On Time}) = 0.5375 \\]\n\nThe overall probability of arriving on time is 53.75%, and the probability of arriving late is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Late}) = 1 - P(\\text{",
