To determine the overall probability of gyzp, we need to consider the probability of gyzp for both those who are xevo and those who are not xevo, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of Xevo (P(Xevo)) = 0.48\n- Probability of Gyzp given not Xevo (P(Gyzp|~Xevo)) = 0.39\n- Probability of Gyzp given Xevo (P(Gyzp|Xevo)) = 0.78\n\nThe overall probability of Gyzp (P(Gyzp)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(Gyzp) = P(Gyzp|Xevo) \\cdot P(Xevo) + P(Gyzp|~Xevo) \\cdot P(~Xevo) \\]\n\nWhere \\( P(~Xevo) = 1 - P(Xevo) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52 \\).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(Gyzp) = (0.78 \\cdot 0.48) + (0.39 \\cdot 0.52) \\]\n\n\\[ P(Gyzp) = 0.3744 + 0.2028 \\]\n\n\\[ P(Gyzp) = 0.577",
