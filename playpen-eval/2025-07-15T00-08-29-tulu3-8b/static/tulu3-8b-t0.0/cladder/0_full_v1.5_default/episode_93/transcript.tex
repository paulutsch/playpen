	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is tijw. Would an individual is not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, an individual would not necessarily be not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo.\\ \tt \\ \tt The reasoning behind this answer is based on the structure of the causal relationships described:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - Xevo has a direct effect on tijv.\\ \tt    - Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp.\\ \tt    - Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Causal Pathways**:\\ \tt    - We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv.\\ \tt    - Xevo directly causes tijv, which then directly causes gyzp.\\ \tt    - Tijw also causes tijv (either directly or indirectly through xevo), and tijv then directly causes gyzp.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Observation**:\\ \tt    - We observe that the individual is tijw.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given these conditions, if the individual is tijw, it means that tijw could have caused tijv directly or indirectly (through xevo), and since tijv has a direct effect on gyzp, the presence of tijw would likely lead to the individual being gyzp, regardless of whether xevo is present or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Explanation**:\\ \tt - If xevo is not present, tijw could still cause tijv (either directly or indirectly), and since tijv directly causes gyzp, the individual would still be g
