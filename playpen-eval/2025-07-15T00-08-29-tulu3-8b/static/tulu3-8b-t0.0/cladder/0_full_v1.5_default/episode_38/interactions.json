The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Solar eclipse has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Method 1: We look at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school case by case according to traffic. Method 2: We look directly at how solar eclipse correlates with Alice arriving to school in general. To understand how solar eclipse affects Alice arriving to school, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Method 1 attempts to account for the confounding variable (traffic) by examining the relationship between solar eclipses and Alice's arrival at school conditional on traffic conditions. This approach is an attempt to control for confounding variables, which is a common strategy in causal inference to isolate the effect of interest.\n\nHowever, Method 2 directly examines the general correlation between solar eclipses and Alice's arrival at school. In a world with only the specified conditions (solar eclipse directly affects Alice arriving to school and traffic directly affects Alice arriving to school), and assuming no other unmentioned factors, Method 2 might initially seem sufficient to assess the direct causal effect of solar eclipses on Alice's arrival.\n\nIn a perfectly controlled and isolated scenario, where we can assume that traffic conditions do not change due to the solar eclipse (i.e., the eclipse does not cause changes in traffic patterns), Method 2 could indeed provide a valid estimate of the causal effect of solar eclipses on Alice's arrival to school. This is because we are assuming that the only direct causal pathway from solar eclipse to Alice's arrival is through some unspecified mechanism (e.g., Alice being distracted by the eclipse, or perhaps a school policy change due to the eclipse).\n\nHowever, Method 1 is generally preferred in real-world causal inference because it accounts",
