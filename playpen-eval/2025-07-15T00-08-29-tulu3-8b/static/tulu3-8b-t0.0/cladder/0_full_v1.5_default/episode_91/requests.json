We are given the following information:\n\n- P(Zuph) = 34% = 0.34\n- P(Not Zuph and Glimx) = 64% = 0.64\n- P(Zuph and Glimx) = 28% = 0.28\n\nWe want to determine if P(Glimx | Zuph) (the probability of Glimx given Zuph) is smaller than P(Glimx).\n\nFirst, calculate P(Glimx) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Glimx) = P(Glimx and Zuph) + P(Glimx and Not Zuph)\n         = P(Zuph and Glimx) + P(Not Zuph and Glimx)\n         = 0.28 + 0.64\n         = 0.92\n\nNext, calculate P(Glimx | Zuph) using the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(Glimx | Zuph) = P(Glimx and Zuph) / P(Zuph)\n                = 0.28 / 0.34\n                ≈ 0.8235\n\nNow, compare P(Glimx) and P(Glimx | Zuph):\n\n- P(Glim",
