Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%.

Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, the chance of wet ground is not necessarily larger when observing a rainy season. \n\nTo understand this, we need to apply the principles of conditional probability and the law of total probability. Let's define the events:\n\n- \\( R \\): Rainy season (with probability \\( P(R) = 0.87 \\))\n- \\( D \\): Dry season (with probability \\( P(D) = 1 - P(R) = 0.13 \\))\n- \\( W_g \\): Wet ground\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- \\( P(W_g \\cap D) = 0.07 \\)\n- \\( P(W_g \\cap R) = 0.50 \\)\n\nWe want to determine \\( P(W_g | R) \\), the probability of wet ground given a rainy season. By the definition of conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(W_g | R) = \\frac{P(W_g \\cap R)}{P(R)} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(W_g | R) = \\frac{0.50}{0.87} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ P(W_g | R) \\approx 0.5758 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( P(W_g) \\), the overall probability of wet ground, using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(W_g) = P(W_g \\cap R) + P(W_g \\cap D) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values",
