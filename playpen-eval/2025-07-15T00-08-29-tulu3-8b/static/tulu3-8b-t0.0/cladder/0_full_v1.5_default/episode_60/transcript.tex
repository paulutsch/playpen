	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of having large feet is not necessarily smaller when observing a college degree or higher. \\ \tt \\ \tt To understand why, let's break down the given information and apply principles of causal inference:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - Unobserved confounders (U) affect both education level (E) and foot size (F).\\ \tt    - Proximity to a college (P) affects education level (E).\\ \tt    - Education level (E) affects foot size (F).\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Probabilities**:\\ \tt    - Probability of college degree or higher (C) = 47%.\\ \tt    - Probability of high school degree or lower and large feet (H, L) = 32%.\\ \tt    - Probability of college degree or higher and large feet (C, L) = 10%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Causal Inference**:\\ \tt    - The presence of unobserved confounders (U) means that there is a common cause affecting both education level and foot size. This confounding can lead to spurious associations between education level and foot size.\\ \tt    - The direct effect of education level on foot size suggests that, on average, higher education might be associated with larger feet, but this is not necessarily a causal relationship due to confounding.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Calculating Conditional Probabilities**:\\ \tt    - The probability of large feet given a college degree or higher (P(L|C)) can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:\\ \tt      \[\\ \tt      P(L|
