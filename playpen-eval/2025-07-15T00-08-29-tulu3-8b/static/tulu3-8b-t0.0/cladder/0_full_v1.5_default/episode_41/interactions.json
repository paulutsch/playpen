The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Education level has a direct effect on skill. Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(College) = 0.06 (Probability of having a college degree or higher)\n- P(Black Hair | High School or Lower) = 0.25 (Probability of having black hair given the person has a high school degree or lower)\n- P(Black Hair | College) = 0.03 (Probability of having black hair given the person has a college degree or higher)\n\nWe want to determine if P(Black Hair | College) < P(Black Hair | High School or Lower).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can express these conditional probabilities as:\n\nP(Black Hair | College) = P(Black Hair ∩ College) / P(College)\n\nWe know P(Black Hair ∩ College) = 0.03 (from the given data) and P(College) = 0.06.\n\nSo, P(Black Hair | College) = 0.03 / 0.06 = 0.5.\n\nNow, let's consider P(Black Hair | High School or Lower):\n\nP(Black Hair | High School or Lower) = P(Black Hair ∩ High School or Lower) / P(High School or Lower)\n\nWe know P(Black Hair ∩ High School or Lower) =",
