We are given the following:\n\n- P(Jyka) = 0.25\n- P(Not Jyka and Kwox) = 0.71\n- P(Jyka and Kwox) = 0.24\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of Kwox (P(Kwox)):\n\nP(Kwox) = P(Kwox and Jyka) + P(Kwox and Not Jyka)\n\nFrom the given data, P(Jyka and Kwox) = 0.24, which is the probability of both Jyka and Kwox occurring together.\n\nTo find P(Kwox and Not Jyka), we use the fact that the probability of Not Jyka and Kwox is 0.71. This can be broken down as:\n\nP(Not Jyka and Kwox) = P(Kwox and Not Jyka)\n\nSo, P(Kwox and Not Jyka) = 0.71.\n\nNow, we can calculate P(Kwox):\n\nP(Kwox) = P(Jyka and Kwox) + P(Kwox and Not Jyka)\nP(Kwox) = 0.24 + 0.71",
