Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved.

For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%.

Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, a college degree or higher does not necessarily increase the chance of a high salary, given the conditions provided.\n\nThe key to understanding this lies in the presence of unobserved confounders that affect both education level and salary, and the direct effect of proximity to a college on education level. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Unobserved Confounders**: These factors, which are not observed, have a direct effect on both education level and salary. This means that there could be underlying characteristics or circumstances (e.g., family background, innate abilities, or socioeconomic status) that influence both a person's educational attainment and their earning potential.\n\n2. **Proximity to a College**: This has a direct effect on education level. People living close to a college are more likely to attain a college degree or higher. However, this does not necessarily mean that the education itself is the primary driver of higher salaries.\n\n3. **Education Level and Salary**: There is a direct effect of education level on salary. However, given the presence of unobserved confounders, we cannot attribute the higher salary observed among those with a college degree solely to the education itself.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- **People Living Far from a College**: \n  - Probability of having a college degree or higher: 57%\n  - Probability of having a high salary: 39%\n\n- **People Living Close to a College**: \n  - Probability of having a college degree or higher: 30%\n",
