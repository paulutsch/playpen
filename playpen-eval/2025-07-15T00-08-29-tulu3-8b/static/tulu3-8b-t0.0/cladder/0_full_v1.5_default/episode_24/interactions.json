The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Unobserved Confounders**: These factors, which are not observed, have a direct effect on both education level and salary. This means that there could be underlying characteristics or circumstances (e.g., family background, innate abilities, or socioeconomic status) that influence both a person's educational attainment and their earning potential.\n\n2. **Proximity to a College**: This has a direct effect on education level. People living close to a college are more likely to attain a college degree or higher. However, this does not necessarily mean that the education itself is the primary driver of higher salaries.\n\n3. **Education Level and Salary**: There is a direct effect of education level on salary. However, given the presence of unobserved confounders, we cannot attribute the higher salary observed among those with a college degree solely to the education itself.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- **People Living Far from a College**: \n  - Probability of having a college degree or higher: 57%\n  - Probability of having a high salary: 39%\n\n- **People Living Close to a College**: \n  - Probability of having a college degree or higher: 30%",
