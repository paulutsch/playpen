Since we observed an individual is Zory, it implies that Zuph is also present because Zory's effect on Zuph is direct and unidirectional.\n\n2. **Zuph causes not Jyka**: This indicates that Zuph has a direct effect on Jyka, but it is such that Zuph prevents Jyka from occurring. However, this does not directly affect the relationship between Zory and Glimx.\n\n3. **Zory or Jyka causes Glimx**: This condition introduces a crucial ambiguity. It suggests that Glimx can be caused either by Zory or by Jyka. Since we know Zory causes Zuph, and Zuph prevents Jyka, the presence of Zory indirectly influences Glimx through Zuph's effect on Jyka.\n\nGiven these relationships, if Zuph were not present (which would only happen if Zory were not present, according to the direct causal link), then Jyka would be present (since Zuph prevents Jyka). However, the crucial point is that Zory still causes Glimx directly,",
