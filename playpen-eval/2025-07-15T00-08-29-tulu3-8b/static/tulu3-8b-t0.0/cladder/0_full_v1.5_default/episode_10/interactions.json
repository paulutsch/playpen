The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers, the probability of college admission is 76%. For smokers, the probability of college admission is 22%. For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

This is because the problem states that smoking has a direct effect on college admission, and the probability of college admission is significantly lower for smokers (22%) compared to nonsmokers (76%). \n\nThe direct effect of smoking on college admission is independent of the effect of effort on admission. Even if effort levels were the same for both smokers and nonsmokers, the lower probability of admission for smokers would still hold due to the direct causal effect of smoking on admission. \n\nIn this simplified hypothetical world, the only factors affecting college admission are smoking status and effort, and smoking status has a more pronounced and direct impact on the outcome. Therefore, controlling for all else being equal (including effort), a smoker would be less likely to be admitted to college compared to a nonsmoker. \n\nThis conclusion is based on the provided probabilities and the direct causal relationship between smoking and college admission, without considering any other potential confounding variables or indirect effects.<|end_of_text|>",
