Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%.

However, when we look at the specific probabilities provided:\n\n- The probability of firing is higher (74%) when both the CEO decides to fire and the manager signs the termination letter compared to when only the CEO decides to fire but the manager does not sign (39%).\n- This difference (74% vs. 39%) might suggest that the manager's action (signing the termination letter) could influence the likelihood of the employee being",
