The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Direct Effects:**\n   - **Gene on Smoking:** The probability of smoking varies with gene type and pollution level.\n   - **Pollution on Smoking:** The probability of smoking also varies with pollution level, even after accounting for gene type.\n   - **Smoking on Lung Cancer:** The probability of lung cancer increases with smoking.\n\n2. **Observed Probabilities:**\n   - **Nonsmoking Genes:**\n     - Nonsmokers: 56% chance of lung cancer.\n     - Smokers: 42% chance of lung cancer.\n   - **Smoking Genes:**\n     - Nonsmokers: 60% chance of lung cancer.\n     - Smokers: 40% chance of lung cancer.\n\n3. **Effect of Pollution:**\n   - **Nonsmoking Genes:**\n     - Low pollution: 76% chance of smoking.\n     - High pollution: 48% chance of smoking.\n   - **Smoking Genes:**\n     - Low pollution: 46% chance of smoking.\n     - High pollution: 21% chance of smoking.\n\n4. **Overall Probability of High Pollution:**\n   -",
