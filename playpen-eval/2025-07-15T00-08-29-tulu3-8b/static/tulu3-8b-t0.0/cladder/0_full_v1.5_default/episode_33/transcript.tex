	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on water quality and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on water quality. Water quality has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. We know that high poverty or global water company causes clean water. high poverty or clean water causes cholera contraction. We observed the person is served by a global water company and the region has low poverty. Would the person gets cholera if polluted water instead of clean water?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the person would not get cholera if they are served by a global water company and the region has low poverty, even if they are exposed to polluted water instead of clean water.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's the reasoning:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - **Poverty and Water Quality**: High poverty directly affects water quality negatively. However, in this scenario, we are told the region has low poverty, which implies a higher likelihood of clean water.\\ \tt    - **Water Company and Water Quality**: A global water company directly affects water quality positively. Given that the person is served by such a company, it is reasonable to assume that the water quality is likely to be clean.\\ \tt    - **Water Quality and Cholera**: Clean water directly reduces the risk of contracting cholera, while polluted water increases the risk.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Given Conditions**:\\ \tt    - **Low Poverty**: This condition suggests that the community has the resources and possibly the infrastructure to maintain clean water systems, reducing the likelihood of polluted water.\\ \tt    - **Served by a Global Water Company**: This implies a well-managed water supply system, which is likely to deliver clean water.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Contradiction in Hypothetical Scenario**:\\ \tt    - The scenario posits polluted water instead of clean water, but given the conditions (low poverty and service by a global water company), the water should be clean. The presence of a global water company and low poverty should mitigate the risk of cholera, even if the
