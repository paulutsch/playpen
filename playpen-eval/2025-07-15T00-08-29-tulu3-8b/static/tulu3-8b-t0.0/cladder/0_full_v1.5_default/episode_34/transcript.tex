	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For people who have not visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 9%. For people who have not visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 54%. For people who have visited England and directors who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 46%. For people who have visited England and directors who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 90%. For people who have not visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 17%. For people who have visited England, the probability of director signing the termination letter is 27%. For people who have visited England, would it be less likely to see employee being fired if the person had not visited England?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be less likely to see an employee being fired if they had not visited England. \\ \tt \\ \tt To understand why, let's break down the given probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Not Visited England, Director Doesn't Sign Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 9%\\ \tt 2. **Not Visited England, Director Signs Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 54%\\ \tt 3. **Visited England, Director Doesn't Sign Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 46%\\ \tt 4. **Visited England, Director Signs Termination Letter:** Probability of being fired = 90%\\ \tt \\ \tt We also know the probabilities of directors signing termination letters for people who have and have not visited England:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Not Visited England:** Probability of signing termination letter = 17%\\ \tt - **Visited England:** Probability of signing termination letter = 27%\\ \tt \\ \tt The key here is to understand the interaction between visiting England, the director's action (signing termination letters), and the outcome (employee being fired).\\ \tt \\ \tt **Direct Effect of Visiting England:**\\ \tt Visiting England increases the likelihood of a director signing a termination letter (from 17% to 27%). This suggests that visiting England might be associated with a more negative workplace environment or a more trigger-happy director.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Effect of Director's Action:**\\ \tt The probability of being fired is significantly higher when a director signs a termination letter, regardless of whether the employee has visited England or not. For instance:\\ \tt - **Not Visited England:**
