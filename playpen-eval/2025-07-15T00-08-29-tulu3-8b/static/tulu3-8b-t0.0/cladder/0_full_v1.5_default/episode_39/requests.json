Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, large feet are not more likely than small feet overall. To determine the overall probability of having large feet, we need to consider both groups: those who use tanning salon treatments and those who do not.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of having large feet for the entire population:\n\n1. **Probability of large feet for those who do not use tanning salon treatments:** 13%\n2. **Probability of not using tanning salon treatments:** 100% - 10% = 90%\n3. **Expected probability of large feet for those who do not use tanning salons (weighted by their probability):** 13% * 90% = 11.7%\n\nNext, calculate the probability of having large feet for those who use tanning salon treatments:\n\n1. **Probability of large feet for those who use tanning salon treatments:** 70%\n2. **Probability of using tanning salon treatments:** 10%\n3. **Expected probability of large feet for those who use tanning salons (weighted by their probability):** 70% * 10% = 7%\n\nNow, combine these two probabilities to find the overall probability of having large feet:\n\n**Overall probability of large feet = (Probability of large feet for non-users * Probability of not being a user) + (Probability of large feet for users * Probability of being a user)**\n**Overall probability of large feet = (11.7% + 7%) = 18.7",
