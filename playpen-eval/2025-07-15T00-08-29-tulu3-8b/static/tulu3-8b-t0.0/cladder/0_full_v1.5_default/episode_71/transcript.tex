	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%. Will yomx increase the chance of xevu?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, yomx does not increase the chance of xevu. \\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the effect of yomx on the probability of xevu, we need to consider the conditional probabilities provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Probability of xevu for those who are not gwet and are not yomx: 82%\\ \tt - Probability of xevu for those who are not gwet and are yomx: 63%\\ \tt - Probability of xevu for those who are gwet and are not yomx: 36%\\ \tt - Probability of xevu for those who are gwet and are yomx: 18%\\ \tt \\ \tt The overall probability of gwet is 41%. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, calculate the expected probability of xevu without considering yomx:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Gwet}) = \frac{(1 - 0.41) \cdot 0.82 + 0.41 \cdot 0.36}{1 - 0.41} \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Gwet}) = \frac{0.59 \cdot 0.82 + 0.41 \cdot 0.36}{0.59} \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Gwet}) = \frac{0.4858 + 0.1476}{0.59} \]\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Gw
