	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on gyzp and hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. Gyzp has a direct effect on lirg. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 63%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 49%. For those who are jyka, would it be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be more likely to see lirg if the individual was not jyka. \\ \tt \\ \tt To understand why, we need to consider the direct and indirect effects on lirg:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - Jyka has a direct effect on lirg.\\ \tt    - Hwax has a direct effect on lirg.\\ \tt    - Gyzp has a direct effect on lirg.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Indirect Effects**:\\ \tt    - Hwax affects lirg directly.\\ \tt    - Gyzp affects lirg directly.\\ \tt    - Jyka affects lirg directly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the information provided, we know:\\ \tt - The probability of lirg for those who are not jyka is 63%.\\ \tt - The probability of lirg for those who are jyka is 49%.\\ \tt \\ \tt The decrease in probability from 63% to 49% when an individual is jyka suggests that being jyka has a negative causal effect on the probability of lirg. This negative effect could be due to the direct effect of jyka on lirg, or it could be mediated through the effects of jyka on hwax and gyzp, which in turn affect lirg.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Reasoning**:\\ \tt - The direct effect of jyka on lirg reduces the probability of lirg from 63% to 49%.\\ \tt - Since gyzp also has
