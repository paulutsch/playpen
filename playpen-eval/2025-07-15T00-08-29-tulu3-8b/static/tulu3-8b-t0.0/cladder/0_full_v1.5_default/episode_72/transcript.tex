	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Cwoi has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on gwet. Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. Cwoi is unobserved. For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%. For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%. For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%. For those who are not yomx, the probability of gwet is 64%. For those who are yomx, the probability of gwet is 8%. For those who are yomx, would it be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it would not be more likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx. \\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, we need to consider the conditional probabilities provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt - For those who are not yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%.\\ \tt - For those who are not yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 94%.\\ \tt - For those who are yomx and are not gwet, the probability of xevu is 31%.\\ \tt - For those who are yomx and are gwet, the probability of xevu is 91%.\\ \tt \\ \tt Firstly, let's calculate the overall probability of xevu for individuals who are not yomx:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Yomx}) = P(Xevu | \text{not Yomx and not Gwet}) \cdot P(\text{not Gwet} | \text{not Yomx}) + P(Xevu | \text{not Yomx and Gwet}) \cdot P(\text{Gwet} | \text{not Yomx}) \]\\ \tt \\ \tt Given:\\ \tt \[ P(Xevu | \text{not Yomx and not Gwet}) = 0.31 \]\\ \tt \[ P(\text{not Gwet} | \text{not Yomx}) = 1 - P(\text
