Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%.

Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, lung cancer is not more likely than the absence of lung cancer overall. \n\nTo determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of lung cancer and compare it to the probability of not having lung cancer. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define the probabilities:**\n   - Probability of smoking (P(S)) = 12% = 0.12\n   - Probability of not smoking (P(¬S)) = 1 - P(S) = 0.88\n   - Probability of lung cancer given smoking (P(C|S)) = 61% = 0.61\n   - Probability of lung cancer given not smoking (P(C|¬S)) = 58% = 0.58\n\n2. **Calculate the overall probability of lung cancer (P(C)):**\n   P(C) = P(C|S) * P(S) + P(C|¬S) * P(¬S)\n   P(C) = (0.61 * 0.12) + (0.58 * 0.88)\n\n3. **Perform the calculations:**\n   P(C) = (0.0732) + (0.5104)\n   P(C) = 0.5836\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of not having lung cancer (P(¬C)):**\n   P(¬C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.583",
