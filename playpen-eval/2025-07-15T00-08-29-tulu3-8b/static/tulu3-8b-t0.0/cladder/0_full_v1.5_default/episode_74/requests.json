To determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of LIRG (let's denote it as P(LIRG)).\n\nGiven:\n- P(Jyka) = 0.14\n- P(LIRG | not Jyka) = 0.71\n- P(LIRG | Jyka) = 0.66\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of LIRG:\n\nP(LIRG) = P(LIRG | Jyka) * P(Jyka) + P(LIRG | not Jyka) * P(not Jyka)\n\nSince P(not Jyka) = 1 - P(Jyka) = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86,\n\nP(LIRG) = (0.66 * 0.14) + (0.71 * 0.86)\n\nCalculating each term:\n- 0.66 * 0.14 = 0.0924\n- 0.71 * 0.86 = 0.6106\n\nAdding these together:\nP(LIRG) = 0.0924 + 0.6106 = 0.703\n\nSince 0.703 is greater than 0.5, the overall probability of LIRG is greater than the probability of not LIRG",
