	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, eating citrus positively affects scurvy through vitamin C. \\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we observe that the probability of scurvy is higher (73%) for patients not consuming citrus compared to those who are (54%). This difference in probabilities suggests a protective effect of citrus consumption against scurvy. \\ \tt \\ \tt The mechanism behind this effect is vitamin C. Citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, which is known to play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of scurvy. Scurvy is a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, leading to symptoms such as weakness, gum disease, and bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given the direct effect of vitamin C on scurvy and the observed probabilities, we can infer that consuming citrus (which provides vitamin C) reduces the risk of scurvy. Therefore, eating citrus positively affects scurvy through its provision of vitamin C, thereby reducing the probability of developing the disease from 73% to 54%. \\ \tt \\ \tt This conclusion is supported by the established causal relationship between vitamin C intake, its role in preventing scurvy, and the observed differences in scurvy prevalence between citrus consumers and non-consumers in this hypothetical world.<|end_of_text|>
