To determine the overall probability of having thick lips, we need to consider both groups: those who receive treatment and those who do not.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of having thick lips for each group:\n\n- Probability of thick lips for those not receiving treatment: 64%\n- Probability of thick lips for those receiving treatment: 29%\n\nNext, calculate the probability of each group:\n\n- Probability of receiving treatment: 48%\n- Probability of not receiving treatment: 52% (since 100% - 48% = 52%)\n\nNow, calculate the overall probability of having thick lips by considering both groups:\n\nOverall probability of thick lips = (Probability of thick lips for those not receiving treatment * Probability of not receiving treatment) + (Probability of thick lips for those receiving treatment * Probability of receiving treatment)\n\nOverall probability of thick lips = (64% * 52%) + (29% * 48%)\n\nOverall probability of thick lips = (0.64 * 0.52) + (0.29 * 0.48)\n\nOverall probability of thick lips = 0.3328 + 0.1392\n\nOverall probability of thick lips = 0.472\n\nConverting to a percentage, the overall probability of having thick lips is 47.2%.\n\nSince 47.2% is less than 50%, thick lips are not more likely than thin lips overall in this hypothetical world.
