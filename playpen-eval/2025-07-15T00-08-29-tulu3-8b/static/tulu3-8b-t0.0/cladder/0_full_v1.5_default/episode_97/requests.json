We know that yupt or zupj causes muvq, but we do not have information about the strength, direction (positive or negative), or the specific conditions under which each causes muvq. \n\nGiven that we observed an individual is not zupj, we can infer that the absence of Zupj does not cause muvq. However, we cannot infer the exact causal effect of Yupt on muvq. It is possible that:\n\n1. Yupt alone is sufficient to cause muvq, in which case if Yupt is present, muvq would occur regardless of whether Zupj is present or not.\n2. Yupt and Zupj might have synergistic or additive effects on muvq, meaning that the presence of Yupt might not be enough to cause muvq if Zupj is absent.\n3. Yupt and Zupj might have opposing effects on muvq, such that the absence of Zupj might counteract the effect of Yupt.\n\nWithout additional information about the nature of the relationships between Yupt, Zupj, and muvq, we cannot definitively say that muvq would occur if Yupt is",
