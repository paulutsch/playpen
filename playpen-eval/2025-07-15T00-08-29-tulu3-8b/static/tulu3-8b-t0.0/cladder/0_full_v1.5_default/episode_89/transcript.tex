	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on wibl. Uvzi has a direct effect on wibl. Method 1: We look at how zuph correlates with uvzi case by case according to wibl. Method 2: We look directly at how zuph correlates with uvzi in general. To understand how zuph affects uvzi, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, it is not more correct to use Method 1 than Method 2 to understand how Zuph affects Uvzi.\\ \tt \\ \tt The reason is that Method 1 involves examining the correlation between Zuph and Uvzi on a case-by-case basis according to Wibl, which introduces a confounding variable (Wibl). This can lead to biased conclusions because Wibl might be a common cause of both Zuph and Uvzi, thereby creating a spurious correlation between Zuph and Uvzi that does not reflect a true causal relationship.\\ \tt \\ \tt In contrast, Method 2 directly examines the correlation between Zuph and Uvzi in general, without introducing Wibl as a confounding factor. This approach is more likely to reveal the true causal relationship between Zuph and Uvzi, assuming that there are no other unmentioned variables affecting both Zuph and Uvzi.\\ \tt \\ \tt In causal inference, it is crucial to control for confounding variables to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions about causal relationships. Method 2, by not introducing Wibl as a confounder, is a more straightforward and reliable approach to understanding the direct effect of Zuph on Uvzi, provided that Wibl does not have a causal effect on both Zuph and Uvzi.\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, while Method 1 might seem intuitive, it is Method 2 that is more correct for understanding the causal relationship between Zuph and Uvzi,
