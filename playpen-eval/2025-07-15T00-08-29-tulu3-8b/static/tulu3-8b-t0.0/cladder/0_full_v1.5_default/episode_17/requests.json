Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, ringing alarm is not more likely than a silent alarm overall. \n\nTo determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of a ringing alarm versus a silent alarm. We'll do this by considering the two groups: husbands who set the alarm and those who do not.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the probability of a ringing alarm for husbands who set the alarm.**\n\nGiven:\n- Probability that a husband sets the alarm = 8% = 0.08\n- Probability of ringing alarm given that the husband sets it = 16% = 0.16\n\nThe joint probability of a ringing alarm given that a husband sets the alarm is:\n\\[ P(\\text{Ringing} \\mid \\text{Set by Husband}) = 0.08 \\times 0.16 = 0.0128 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of a ringing alarm for husbands who do not set the alarm.**\n\nGiven:\n- Probability that a husband does not set the alarm = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92\n- Probability of ringing alarm given that the husband does not set it = 75% = 0.75\n\nThe joint probability of a ringing alarm given that a husband does not set the alarm is:\n\\[ P(\\text{Ringing} \\mid \\text{Not Set by Husband}) = 0.92 \\times 0.75 = 0.69 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate",
