Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox.

Even if Jyka is not present, Yupt could still be caused by Qwiu directly (since Qwiu causes Jyka, and Jyka causes Yupt, but Qwiu also has a direct effect on Yupt). Therefore, the absence of Jyka does not necessarily imply the absence of Yupt, and consequently, does not necessarily imply the absence of Kwox either.\n\nTo summarize, the absence of Qwiu does not directly affect Kwox's presence. The causal pathway from Qwiu to Kwox is indirect and mediated by Jyka and Yupt",
