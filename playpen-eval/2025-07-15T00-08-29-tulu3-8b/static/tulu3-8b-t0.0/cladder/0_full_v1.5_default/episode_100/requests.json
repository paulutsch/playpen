However, the question asks about the effect of changing Zuph from \"not zuph\" to \"zuph\" while keeping Jyka constant.\n\n5. **Causal Mediation**:\n   - Since Jyka already has a direct effect on Zuph, and Zuph has a direct effect on Glimx, changing Zuph from \"not zuph\" to \"zuph\" would directly increase the likelihood of Glimx being present, assuming all other conditions remain unchanged.\n\n6. **Conclusion**",
