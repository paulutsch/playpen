	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on zory and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. We know that jyka causes not zuph and zory. zuph and zory causes glimx. We observed an individual is jyka. Would an individual is glimx if zuph instead of not zuph?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, an individual would not necessarily be glimx if zuph instead of not zuph, given the provided causal structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's the reasoning based on the given causal diagram:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Direct Effects**: \\ \tt    - Jyka → Zory\\ \tt    - Jyka → Zuph\\ \tt    - Zory → Glimx\\ \tt    - Zuph → Glimx\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Causal Pathways**:\\ \tt    - The direct effect of Jyka on Glimx is mediated through both Zory and Zuph.\\ \tt    - If Jyka is present, it directly affects both Zory and Zuph, which in turn directly affect Glimx.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Given Condition**:\\ \tt    - We know that Jyka is present.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Effect of Zuph**:\\ \tt    - Zuph has a direct effect on Glimx. However, the question asks about the effect of changing Zuph from "not zuph" to "zuph" while keeping Jyka constant.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. **Causal Mediation**:\\ \tt    - Since Jyka already has a direct effect on Zuph, and Zuph has a direct effect on Glimx, changing Zuph from "not zuph" to "zuph" would directly increase the likelihood of Glimx being present, assuming all other conditions remain unchanged.\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. **Conclusion**
