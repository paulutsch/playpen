For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.\n<|assistant|>\nNo, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall. \n\nTo determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance and compare it to the probability of admission rejection.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of admission acceptance:\n\n- Probability of being male (P(Male)) = 54% = 0.54\n- Probability of admission acceptance given male (P(Admit | Male)) = 24% = 0.24\n- Probability of admission acceptance given not male (P(Admit | Not Male)) = 49% = 0.49\n\nThe overall probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Admit) = P(Admit | Male) * P(Male) + P(Admit | Not Male) * P(Not Male)\n\nSince P(Not Male) = 1 - P(Male) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46,\n\nP(Admit) = (0.24 * 0.54) + (0.49 * 0.46)\n\nP(Admit) = 0.1296 + 0.2254\n\nP(Admit) = 0.355\n\nSo, the overall probability of admission acceptance is 35.5%.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of admission rejection:\n\nThe probability of admission rejection (P(Reject)) is the complement of the probability",
