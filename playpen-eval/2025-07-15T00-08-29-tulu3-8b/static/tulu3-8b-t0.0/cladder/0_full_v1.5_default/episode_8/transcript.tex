	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, admission acceptance is not less likely than admission rejection overall. \\ \tt \\ \tt To determine this, we need to calculate the overall probability of admission acceptance and compare it to the probability of admission rejection.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's calculate the probability of admission acceptance:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Probability of being male (P(Male)) = 54% = 0.54\\ \tt - Probability of admission acceptance given male (P(Admit | Male)) = 24% = 0.24\\ \tt - Probability of admission acceptance given not male (P(Admit | Not Male)) = 49% = 0.49\\ \tt \\ \tt The overall probability of admission acceptance (P(Admit)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Admit) = P(Admit | Male) * P(Male) + P(Admit | Not Male) * P(Not Male)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(Not Male) = 1 - P(Male) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46,\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Admit) = (0.24 * 0.54) + (0.49 * 0.46)\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Admit) = 0.1296 + 0.2254\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Admit) = 0.355\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the overall probability of admission acceptance is 35.5%.\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, we calculate the probability of admission rejection:\\ \tt \\ \tt The probability of admission rejection (P(Reject)) is the complement of the probability
