However, we need to carefully consider the direct and indirect effects at play:\n\n1. **Direct Effects**: \n   - Speaking English has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan.\n   - Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan.\n   - Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan.\n\n2. **Observed Probabilities**:\n   - Probability of long lifespan for those who do not speak English: 70%.\n   - Probability of long lifespan for those who speak English: 38%.\n\n3. **Unobserved Variable**: \n   - Smoking is unobserved, which means we do not have direct information about smoking habits for different language groups.\n\nGiven these conditions, we cannot directly infer that not speaking English would lead to a higher probability of a long lifespan for those who already speak English. Here's why:\n\n- **Confounding by Smoking**: The unobserved variable (smoking) could be a significant confounder. People who speak English might have different smoking habits compared to those who do not speak English. If English speakers are more likely to smoke (a possibility given the direct effect of smoking on diabetes and lifespan), then the lower probability of long lifespan among English speakers could be due to higher smoking rates rather than the act of speaking English itself.\n\n- **",
