	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 59%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 28%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 29%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 77%. Does gender positively affect admission status through department competitiveness?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, gender does not positively affect admission status through department competitiveness in this hypothetical world.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this, we need to consider the effect of gender on the probability of being admitted to a competitive department and then how this affects the admission status.\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Probability of Applying to a Competitive Department by Gender:**\\ \tt    - For individuals who are not male, the probability of applying to a competitive department is 29%.\\ \tt    - For individuals who are male, the probability is 77%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Probability of Admission Given Department Competitiveness and Gender:**\\ \tt    - For individuals who are not male and apply to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission is 58%.\\ \tt    - For individuals who are not male and apply to a competitive department, the probability of admission is 25%.\\ \tt    - For individuals who are male and apply to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission is 59%.\\ \tt    - For individuals who are male and apply to a competitive department, the probability of admission is 28%.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Effect of Gender on Admission Status:**\\ \tt    - When looking at non-competitive departments, the admission probability is higher for males (59%) compared to non-males (58%), but the difference is negligible (1%).\\ \tt    - When looking at competitive departments, the admission probability is lower for males (28%) compared to non-males (25%), indicating a negative effect of being male in competitive departments.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Effect of Department Competitiveness
