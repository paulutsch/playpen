The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kidney stone size has a direct effect on treatment and recovery. Treatment has a direct effect on recovery. Method 1: We look directly at how treatment correlates with recovery in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to kidney stone size. To understand how treatment affects recovery, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, this approach does not account for the potential heterogeneity in treatment effects that may arise due to differences in kidney stone size. This heterogeneity could lead to misleading conclusions if the average effect does not accurately represent the effect for any specific subgroup, such as patients with very large or very small stones.\n\nMethod 2, on the other hand, examines the correlation between treatment and recovery on a case-by-case basis according to kidney stone size. This approach allows for the identification of potential effect modification or interaction effects, where the effect of treatment on recovery might differ depending on the size of the kidney stone. By stratifying the analysis by stone size, researchers can uncover more nuanced insights into the causal relationship between treatment and recovery, potentially revealing that different treatments are more effective for different stone sizes.\n\nIn causal inference, it is often crucial to consider potential effect modifiers or confounders, which in this case could be the size of the kidney stone. Ignoring these potential differences (as Method 1 does) can lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect. Therefore, Method 2, which accounts for the heterogeneity introduced by kidney stone size, is generally more informative and likely to provide a",
