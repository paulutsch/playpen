The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. We know that rixq or swoy causes zuph. rixq and swoy and zuph causes xevu. We observed an individual is not swoy. Would an individual is xevu if rixq instead of not rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The presence or absence of Rixq will affect Zuph, but Zuph's effect on Xevu is already conditioned on the presence of Zuph, which is a direct consequence of either Rixq or Swoy.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Since Swoy is unobserved and the individual is not Swoy, we cannot determine if the absence of Swoy is due to its non-existence or its non-effectiveness.\n- The direct effect of Rixq on Zuph does not guarantee a direct effect on Xevu, as Zuph's effect",
