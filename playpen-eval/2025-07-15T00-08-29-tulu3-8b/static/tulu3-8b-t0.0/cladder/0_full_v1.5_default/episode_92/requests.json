The presence or absence of Rixq will affect Zuph, but Zuph's effect on Xevu is already conditioned on the presence of Zuph, which is a direct consequence of either Rixq or Swoy.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Since Swoy is unobserved and the individual is not Swoy, we cannot determine if the absence of Swoy is due to its non-existence or its non-effectiveness.\n- The direct effect of Rixq on Zuph does not guarantee a direct effect on Xevu, as Zuph's effect",
