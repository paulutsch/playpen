	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 17%. The probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing alarm is 69%. The probability of alarm set by husband and ringing alarm is 3%. Is the chance of ringing alarm smaller when observing alarm set by husband?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of the alarm ringing is not smaller when observing that it was set by the husband.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this, we need to consider the probabilities provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Probability of alarm set by husband (P(Husband)):** 17% or 0.17\\ \tt 2. **Probability of alarm not set by husband and ringing (P(Alarm rings | Not set by husband)):** 69% or 0.69\\ \tt 3. **Probability of alarm set by husband and ringing (P(Alarm rings | Set by husband)):** 3% or 0.03\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to compare the overall probability of the alarm ringing, considering whether it was set by the husband or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Overall Probability of Alarm Ringing:**\\ \tt \\ \tt - **When set by husband (P(Alarm rings)):**\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   P(\text{Alarm rings}) = P(\text{Set by husband}) \times P(\text{Rings | Set by husband}) = 0.17 \times 0.03 = 0.0051\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt \\ \tt - **When not set by husband (P(Alarm rings | Not set by husband)):**\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   P(\text{Alarm rings | Not set by husband}) = 0.69\\ \tt   \]\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Overall Probability of Alarm Ringing (considering both scenarios):**\\ \tt   \[\\ \tt   P(\text{Alarm rings}) = P(\text{Set by husband}) \
