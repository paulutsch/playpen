We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Jyka) = 0.14\n- P(Not Jyka) = 0.86 (since P(Jyka) + P(Not Jyka) = 1)\n- P(Lirg | Not Jyka) = 0.72\n- P(Jyka and Lirg) = 0.12\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of Lirg occurring under the condition that Jyka has occurred (P(Lirg | Jyka)):\n\nP(Jyka and Lirg) = P(Jyka) * P(Lirg | Jyka)\n\nWe need to find P(Lirg | Jyka):\n\nP(Lirg | Jyka) = P(Jyka and Lirg) / P(Jyka)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nP(Lirg | Jyka) = 0.12 / 0.14\n\nP(Lirg | Jyka) = 0.8571 (approximately)\n\nNow compare P(Lirg | Jyka) with P(Lirg | Not Jyka):\n\nP(Lirg | Not Jyka) = 0.72\n\nSince P(Lirg | Jyka)",
