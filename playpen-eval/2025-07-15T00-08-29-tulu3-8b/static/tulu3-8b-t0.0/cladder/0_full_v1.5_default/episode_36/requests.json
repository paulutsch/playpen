Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%.

To determine the overall probability of wet ground, we need to consider both scenarios: when there is a full moon and when there is no full moon.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of wet ground when there is no full moon:\n- Probability of no full moon = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84\n- Given no full moon, the probability of wet ground = 0.56\n\nNext, calculate the probability of wet ground when there is a full moon:\n- Probability of full moon = 0.16\n- Given full moon, the probability of wet ground = 0.54\n\nNow, calculate the overall probability of wet ground:\n- Overall probability of wet ground = (Probability of no full moon * Probability of wet ground given no full moon) + (Probability of full moon * Probability of wet ground given full moon)\n- Overall probability of wet ground = (0.84 * 0.56) + (0.16 * 0.54)\n\nCalculate each term:\n- (0.84 * 0.56) = 0.4704\n- (0.16 * 0.54) = 0.0864\n\nAdd these probabilities together:\n- Overall probability of wet ground = 0.4704 + 0.0864 = 0.5568\n\nThe overall probability of wet ground is 0.5568, which is less than",
