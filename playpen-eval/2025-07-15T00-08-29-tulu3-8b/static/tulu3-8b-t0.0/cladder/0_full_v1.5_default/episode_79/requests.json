To determine the overall probability of rukz, we need to consider the probability of rukz for both those who are pexu and those who are not pexu, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of rukz for the entire population:\n\n1. **Probability of rukz for those who are not pexu:** 66%\n2. **Probability of rukz for those who are pexu:** 22%\n3. **Probability of being pexu:** 41%\n4. **Probability of not being pexu:** 1 - 41% = 59%\n\nNow, calculate the weighted average probability of rukz:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{rukz}) = P(\\text{not pexu}) \\times P(\\text{rukz}|\\text{not pexu}) + P(\\text{pexu}) \\times P(\\text{rukz}|\\text{pexu}) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{rukz}) = (0.59 \\times 0.66) + (0.41 \\times 0.22) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{rukz}) = 0.3884 + 0.0902 \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{rukz}) = 0.4786 \\]\n\nSince 0.4786 is less than 0.5, rukz",
