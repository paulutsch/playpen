The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a brother has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of having a brother is 1%. The probability of not having a brother and ringing alarm is 64%. The probability of having a brother and ringing alarm is 0%. Is the chance of ringing alarm larger when observing having a brother?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

In contrast, the probability of ringing an alarm given that someone does not have a brother is 64%.\n\nTherefore, the chance of ringing an alarm is significantly larger when observing that someone does not have a brother (0.64) compared to when observing that someone has a brother (0).\n\nThe key point here is that the direct effect of having a brother on the alarm clock is null (P(Alarm | B) = 0), whereas the direct effect of not having a brother and ringing an alarm is substantial (P(Alarm | ¬B) = 0.64). Thus, observing having a brother does not increase the likelihood of the alarm ringing, and in",
