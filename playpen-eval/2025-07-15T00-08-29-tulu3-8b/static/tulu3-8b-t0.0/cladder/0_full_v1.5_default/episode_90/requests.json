Hwax has a direct effect on rukz. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 9%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 18%.

However, the provided information does not support this claim.\n\nThe given data states:\n- Probability of rukz for non-pexu individuals (not pexu) is 9%.\n- Probability of rukz for pexu individuals (pexu) is 18%.\n\nWhen we condition on an individual being pexu, we are already considering the group for which rukz is more likely (18% chance compared to 9% for non-pexu). The presence of the pexu status already accounts for a higher likelihood of rukz. \n\nTo clarify, the question seems to be asking whether the probability of rukz would drop from 18% to something less than 9% if we were to condition on the individual not being pexu, given that they are currently pexu. However, this is not a valid comparison based on the provided data. \n\nThe correct interpretation of the data is that pexu status increases the likelihood of rukz from 9% to 18%. Therefore, if we were to condition on an individual not being pexu (i.e., considering only those who are not pexu), the probability of",
