To determine the overall probability of black hair, we need to consider both groups: those who use tanning salon treatments and those who do not.\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of tanning salon treatment (P(T)) = 99%\n- Probability of black hair for those not using tanning salons (P(B|¬T)) = 66%\n- Probability of black hair for those using tanning salons (P(B|T)) = 24%\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of black hair (P(B)) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|¬T) * P(¬T)\n\nWhere P(¬T) is the probability of not using a tanning salon treatment, which is 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nP(B) = (0.24 * 0.99) + (0.66 * 0.01)\nP(B) = 0.2376 + 0.0066\nP(B) = 0.2442\n\nThe overall probability of black hair (P(B)) is 0.2442, or 24.42%. \n\nTo compare this with the likelihood of blond hair, we would need additional information about the probability of blond hair under both conditions (using t",
