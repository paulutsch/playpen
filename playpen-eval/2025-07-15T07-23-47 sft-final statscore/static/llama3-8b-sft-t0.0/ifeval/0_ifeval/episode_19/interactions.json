Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Positive Reinforcement Training**: Focus on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. This method encourages your puppy to learn through association and repetition.\n2. **Clicker Training**: Use a clicker to mark desired behaviors and reward them immediately. This method is effective for teaching specific actions and can be fun for both you and your puppy.\n3. **Housebreaking**: Establish a routine for feeding, playtime, and potty breaks to help your puppy learn to eliminate outside. Consistency is key in this process.\n4. **Socialization**: Expose your puppy to various environments, people, and animals to help them become confident and well-adjusted. Socialization is crucial during the first few months of a puppy's life.\n5. **Basic Commands**: Teach your puppy basic commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"come,\" and \"leave it.\" These commands will help you communicate effectively and establish boundaries.\n\nWhich one you choose?",
