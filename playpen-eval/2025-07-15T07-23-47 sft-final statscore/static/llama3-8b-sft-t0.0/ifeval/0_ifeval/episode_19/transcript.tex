	 Congratulations on your new furry family member! Training a puppy requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Here are a few options to consider:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Positive Reinforcement Training**: Focus on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. This method encourages your puppy to learn through association and repetition.\\ \tt 2. **Clicker Training**: Use a clicker to mark desired behaviors and reward them immediately. This method is effective for teaching specific actions and can be fun for both you and your puppy.\\ \tt 3. **Housebreaking**: Establish a routine for feeding, playtime, and potty breaks to help your puppy learn to eliminate outside. Consistency is key in this process.\\ \tt 4. **Socialization**: Expose your puppy to various environments, people, and animals to help them become confident and well-adjusted. Socialization is crucial during the first few months of a puppy's life.\\ \tt 5. **Basic Commands**: Teach your puppy basic commands like "sit," "stay," "come," and "leave it." These commands will help you communicate effectively and establish boundaries.\\ \tt \\ \tt Which one you choose?
