	 Rewrite the following text so that it is funny to software engineers using notations from the book "The C Programming Language": "The use of the various constructions described in this chapter is one of the most distinctive features of the C programming language." Make this sound like it is being said by the president of the United States and capitalize every letter.

IT IS A LANGUAGE THAT IS AS POWERFUL AS IT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH ITS USE OF POINTERS AND STRUCTURES, ITS ABILITY TO HANDLE MEMORY WITH EASE, AND ITS FLEXIBILITY IN ALLOWING US TO WRITE CODE THAT IS BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. SO LET US RAISE A GLASS TO THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, AND TO THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WHO USE IT TO CREATE THE INNOVATIONS THAT WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE."
