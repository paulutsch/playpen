I know we've been friends for a long time, and I value our relationship deeply. However, I wanted to share with you some things that trigger me, so we can better understand each other and communicate more effectively.\n\nFirstly, I want to mention that I'm a very sensitive person, and I often take things personally. When you make jokes or comments that are meant to be light-hearted but end up hurting my feelings, it can be really tough for me to shake off. I know you didn't mean to hurt me, but it's hard for me to separate the intent from the impact.\n\nAnother thing that triggers me is when you don't listen to me or dismiss my feelings. I know we all get busy and sometimes we might not be fully present in conversations, but when you don't make an effort to understand where I'm coming from, it makes me feel unheard and unimportant.\n\nLastly, I want to mention that I'm still working on my self-esteem, and sometimes your words or actions can make me feel like I'm not good enough. I know you're trying to help, but it's not always helpful to tell me what I'm doing wrong or what I need to improve on. Instead, I would appreciate it if you could offer constructive feedback and support me in a more positive way.\n\nI hope you understand where I'm coming from, and I hope we can work together to create a more supportive and understanding environment for each other. I value our friendship so much, and I want us to be able to communicate openly and honestly with each other.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feelings on this matter.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\"\n\n\"<|eot_id|>",
