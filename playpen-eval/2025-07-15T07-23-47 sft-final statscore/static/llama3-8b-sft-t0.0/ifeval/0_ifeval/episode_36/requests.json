The Pixel 3A runs on Android 9.0 (Pie) out of the box, but it has received several software updates, including Android 10 and Android 11.\n\n**Camera:**\nThe Pixel 3A features a single 12.2-megapixel rear camera with a f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization. The camera is capable of capturing high-quality photos and videos, with features like Portrait mode, Night Sight, and Super Res Zoom. The front camera is a 8-megapixel sensor with a f/2.0 aperture, which is suitable for selfies and video calls.\n\n**Battery Life:**\nThe Pixel 3A has a 3000mAh battery, which provides a decent battery life.
