	 Please rewrite the following sentence in a serious tone, similar to the president of the united states, and without an upward bias or inflation alarmism. Please also include the keywords "ink" and "memoirs" in the sentence: "The main points to consider are the following: First, the ECBâ€™s own forecasts, which currently have a strong upward bias, must be revised downwards. Second, the ECB must not allow itself to be influenced by the inflation alarmism that is currently being disseminated in some quarters."

	 As the President of the United States, I would rephrase the given sentence as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt "The key considerations are: Firstly, the ECB's own projections, which currently exhibit a notable upward inclination, must be reassessed with a more conservative outlook. Secondly, the ECB must remain vigilant against the potential influence of inflationary concerns that are being widely discussed, while also considering the importance of preserving the integrity of its decision-making process, much like the careful consideration of a writer crafting their memoirs with precision, and the deliberate application of ink to the page."
