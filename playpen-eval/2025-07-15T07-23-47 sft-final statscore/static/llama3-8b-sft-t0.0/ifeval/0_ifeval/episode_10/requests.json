Task Summary\nImplement a new feature in the software that allows users to upload and share files securely. The feature should include encryption, access control, and versioning.\n\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\nThe current software lacks a secure file sharing feature, which is a major limitation for users who need to collaborate on projects or share sensitive information. This new feature will enhance the software's functionality and user experience.\n\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n1. Design and implement the encryption algorithm for file upload and sharing.\n2. Develop the access control system to manage user permissions.\n3. Implement versioning to track changes to shared files.\n4. Integrate the new feature with the existing user interface.\n\n***\nPart 4. Timeline\n- Week 1: Research and design the encryption algorithm.\n- Week 2-3: Implement the encryption algorithm and access control system.\n- Week 4-5: Implement versioning and integrate the new feature with the existing UI.\n- Week 6: Test and deploy the new feature.\n\n***\nPart 5. Doc history\nThis document was created on [date] and will be updated as necessary.<|eot_id|>",
