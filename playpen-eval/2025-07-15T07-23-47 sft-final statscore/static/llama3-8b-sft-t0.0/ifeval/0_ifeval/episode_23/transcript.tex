	 I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. My wife, Sarah, came into the room and sat down next to me. "Hey, what's up?" she asked. I shrugged. "Not much. Just watching TV." She nodded and picked up the remote. "What's on?" she asked. I pointed to the screen. "That's a movie. It's about a guy who goes on a quest." She raised an eyebrow. "A quest? Sounds interesting. Let's watch it." I nodded and we sat there in silence for a while, watching the movie. After a while, Sarah got up and went to the kitchen. "I'm going to make some popcorn," she said. I nodded and continued watching the movie. When she came back with the popcorn, she sat down next to me again. "Thanks," I said. She smiled and handed me a handful of popcorn. I took it and we sat there in silence for a while, munching on the popcorn and watching the movie.
