My wife, Sarah, came into the room and sat down next to me. \"Hey, what's up?\" she asked. I shrugged. \"Not much. Just watching TV.\" She nodded and picked up the remote. \"What's on?\" she asked. I pointed to the screen. \"That's a movie. It's about a guy who goes on a quest.\" She raised an eyebrow. \"A quest? Sounds interesting. Let's watch it.\" I nodded and we sat there in silence for a while, watching the movie. After a while, Sarah got up and went to the kitchen. \"I'm going to make some popcorn,\" she said. I nodded and continued watching the movie. When she came back with the popcorn, she sat down next to me again. \"Thanks,\" I said. She smiled and handed me a handful of popcorn. I took it and we sat there in silence for a while, munching on the popcorn and watching the movie.<|eot_id|>",
