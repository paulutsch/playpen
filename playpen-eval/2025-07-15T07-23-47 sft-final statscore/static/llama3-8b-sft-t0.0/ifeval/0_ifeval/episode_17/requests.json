Since each member has at least one pet, the number of members with 0 pets is \\( 20 - x \\). The total number of pets is 32, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 0(20 - x) = 32 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x = 32 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{32}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a person), the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is the largest integer less than or equal to \\( \\frac{32}{3} \\).\n\n\\[ x = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{32}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 10.666... \\right\\rfloor = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is 10.\"<|eot_id|>",
