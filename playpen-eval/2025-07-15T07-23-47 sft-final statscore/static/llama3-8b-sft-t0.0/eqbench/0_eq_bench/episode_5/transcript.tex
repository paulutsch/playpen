	 \\ \tt Your task is to predict the likely emotional responses of a character in this dialogue:\\ \tt \\ \tt Olivia: I found another bottle, dad.\\ \tt Malcolm: So you've become a detective now, have you?\\ \tt Olivia: This isn't a joke, dad. You're killing yourself.\\ \tt Malcolm: Well, at least someone's trying to.\\ \tt Olivia: That's not funny!\\ \tt Malcolm: You're right, it's not. But it's easier than facing the truth.\\ \tt Olivia: And what truth is that, dad? That you're a drunk? That you've wasted your life? That you're a disappointment?\\ \tt Malcolm: That's a bit harsh, don't you think?\\ \tt Olivia: No, it's not. It's the truth. And it's about time someone said it.\\ \tt Malcolm: And you think you're the one to do it? My own daughter?\\ \tt Olivia: Who else, dad? Who else is left?\\ \tt Malcolm: I don't need this right now.\\ \tt Olivia: And when will you need it, dad? When you're on your deathbed? When it's too late?\\ \tt Malcolm: I said I don't need this!\\ \tt Olivia: And I don't need a drunk for a father! But here we are!\\ \tt Malcolm: You ungrateful...\\ \tt Olivia: What? Ungrateful? For what? For the years of neglect? For the embarrassment? For the fear?\\ \tt Malcolm: I did the best I could!\\ \tt Olivia: Your best was never good enough, dad. It never was.\\ \tt [End dialogue]\\ \tt \\ \tt At the end of this dialogue, Olivia would feel...\\ \tt Empowered\\ \tt Pity\\ \tt Guilt\\ \tt Frustration\\ \tt \\ \tt Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\\ \tt \\ \tt You must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\\ \tt \\ \tt Empowered: <score>\\ \tt Pity: <score>\\ \tt Guilt: <score>\\ \tt Frustration: <score>\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt [End of answer]\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer:\\ \tt
