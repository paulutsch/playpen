All that time and money spent on Mars, and what have you got to show for it? \\ \tt Dr. Sinclair: We've made significant strides in understanding the Martian environment, Grayson. It's not about instant results. \\ \tt Grayson: Or maybe it's about keeping the public distracted while you hide the real truth.\\ \tt Dr. Sinclair: And what truth would that be, Mr. Hawk?\\ \tt Grayson: That there are aliens out there, and you people at NASA know it.\\ \tt Dr. Sinclair: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, Grayson.\\ \tt Grayson: Oh, I have evidence. I've got testimonials, photos, documents...\\ \tt Dr. Sinclair: Anecdotes and blurry photos aren't evidence, Grayson. They're stories. \\ \tt Grayson: Stories that you're too afraid to believe.\\ \tt [End dialogue]\\ \tt \\ \tt At the end of this dialogue, Grayson would feel...\\ \tt Accusatory\\ \tt Victimized\\ \tt Superior\\ \tt Understanding\\ \tt \\ \tt Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each.\\ \tt \\ \tt You must output in the following format, including headings (of course, you should give your own scores), with no additional commentary:\\ \tt \\ \tt Accusatory: <score>\\ \tt Victimized: <score>\\ \tt Superior: <score>\\ \tt Understanding: <score>\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt [End of answer]\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember: zero is a valid score, meaning they are likely not feeling that emotion. You must score at least one emotion > 0.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer:\\ \tt
