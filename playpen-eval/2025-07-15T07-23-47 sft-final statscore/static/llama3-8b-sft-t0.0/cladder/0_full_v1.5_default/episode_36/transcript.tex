	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%. Is wet ground more likely than dry ground overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of wet ground is 56% when there is no full moon and 54% when there is a full moon. The overall probability of full moon is 16%, so the overall probability of wet ground is 0.84 * 0.56 + 0.16 * 0.54 = 0.56 + 0.0864 = 0.6464, which is greater than 0.5. Therefore, wet ground is more likely than dry ground overall.
