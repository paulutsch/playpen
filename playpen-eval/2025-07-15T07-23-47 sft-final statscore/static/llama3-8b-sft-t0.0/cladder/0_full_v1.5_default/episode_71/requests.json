Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%.

We are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%.\n2. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%.\n3. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%.\n4. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%.\n5. The overall probability of gwet is 41%.\n\nWe need to calculate the overall probability of xevu and compare it with the probability of xevu when yomx is present.\n\nLet's denote the probability of gwet as P(gwet) = 0.41 and the probability of yomx as P(yomx) = 1 - P(not yomx). We are given that the overall probability of xevu is not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability.\n\nThe law of total probability states that the overall probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the event given each possible cause, weighted by the probability of each cause.\n\nLet's denote the probability of xevu as P(xevu). We can write the law of total probability as",
