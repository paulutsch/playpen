Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz. The overall probability of pexu is 41%. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%. Is rukz more likely than not rukz overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. Hwax has a direct effect on kraz and pexu.\n2. Pexu has a direct effect on rukz.\n3. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz.\n4. The overall probability of pexu is 41%.\n5. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%.\n6. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%.\n\nWe need to calculate the overall probability of rukz, which can be done by considering the probabilities of rukz for both pexu and non-pexu individuals and then combining them based on the overall probability of pexu.\n\nLet's denote the probability of rukz as P(rukz). We have two scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1:** If an individual is not pexu (with probability 1 - 0.41 = 0.59), the probability of rukz is 0.66.\n- **Scenario 2:** If an individual is pexu (with probability 0.41), the probability of rukz is 0.22.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of rukz as a weighted average of these two scenarios, where the weights are the probabilities of being pexu and not pexu:\n\n\\[ P(rukz",
