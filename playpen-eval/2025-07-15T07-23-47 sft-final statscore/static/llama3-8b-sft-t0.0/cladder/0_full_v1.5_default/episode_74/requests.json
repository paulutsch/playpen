Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%.

The overall probability of lirg can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the probability of lirg for those who are jyka:\n   - Probability of jyka: 14%\n   - Probability of lirg given jyka: 66%\n   - Probability of lirg for those who are jyka: 14% * 66% = 0.0924 or 9.24%\n\n2. Calculate the probability of lirg for those who are not jyka:\n   - Probability of not jyka: 100% - 14% = 86%\n   - Probability of lirg given not jyka: 71%\n   - Probability of lirg for those who are not jyka: 86% * 71% = 0.6116 or 61.16%\n\n3. Calculate the overall probability of lirg:\n   - Overall probability of lirg = (probability of lirg for those who are jyka) + (probability of lirg for those who are not jyka)\n   - Overall probability of lirg = 9.24% + 61.16% = 70.4%\n\nSince 70.4% is greater than 50%, lirg is more likely than not lirg overall.<|eot_id|>",
