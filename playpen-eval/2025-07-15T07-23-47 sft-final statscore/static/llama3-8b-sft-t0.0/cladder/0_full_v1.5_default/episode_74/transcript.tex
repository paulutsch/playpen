	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on lirg. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%. Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The overall probability of lirg can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Calculate the probability of lirg for those who are jyka:\\ \tt    - Probability of jyka: 14%\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg given jyka: 66%\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg for those who are jyka: 14% * 66% = 0.0924 or 9.24%\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. Calculate the probability of lirg for those who are not jyka:\\ \tt    - Probability of not jyka: 100% - 14% = 86%\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg given not jyka: 71%\\ \tt    - Probability of lirg for those who are not jyka: 86% * 71% = 0.6116 or 61.16%\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Calculate the overall probability of lirg:\\ \tt    - Overall probability of lirg = (probability of lirg for those who are jyka) + (probability of lirg for those who are not jyka)\\ \tt    - Overall probability of lirg = 9.24% + 61.16% = 70.4%\\ \tt \\ \tt Since 70.4% is greater than 50%, lirg is more likely than not lirg overall.
