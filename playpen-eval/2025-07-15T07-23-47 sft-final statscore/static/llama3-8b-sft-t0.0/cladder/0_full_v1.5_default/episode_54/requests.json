We are given the following information:\n\n1. The probability of speaking English is 93%.\n2. The probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English is 79%.\n3. The probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English is 65%.\n\nLet's break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English:**\n   - Probability of speaking English: 93% = 0.93\n   - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English: 65% = 0.65\n   - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English: 0.93 * 0.65 = 0.6035\n\n2. **Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English:**\n   - Probability of not speaking English: 1 - 0.93 = 0.07\n   - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English: 79% = 0.79\n   - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English: 0.07 * 0.79 = 0.0553\n\n3. **Overall probability of the forest being on fire:**\n   - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak",
