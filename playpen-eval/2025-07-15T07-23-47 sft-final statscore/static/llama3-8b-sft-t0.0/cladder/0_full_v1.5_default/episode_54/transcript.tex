	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on the forest. The smoker has a direct effect on the forest. The overall probability of speaking english is 93%. For people who do not speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 79%. For people who speak english, the probability of the forest on fire is 65%. Is the forest on fire more likely than the forest not on fire overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the overall probability of the forest being on fire. We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. The probability of speaking English is 93%.\\ \tt 2. The probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English is 79%.\\ \tt 3. The probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English is 65%.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's break down the problem into two parts:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English:**\\ \tt    - Probability of speaking English: 93% = 0.93\\ \tt    - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English: 65% = 0.65\\ \tt    - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak English: 0.93 * 0.65 = 0.6035\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English:**\\ \tt    - Probability of not speaking English: 1 - 0.93 = 0.07\\ \tt    - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English: 79% = 0.79\\ \tt    - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who do not speak English: 0.07 * 0.79 = 0.0553\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Overall probability of the forest being on fire:**\\ \tt    - Probability of the forest being on fire for people who speak
