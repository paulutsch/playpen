	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of increased price is 44% when supply is reduced and 81% when supply is increased. Since the overall probability of increased supply is 78%, the overall probability of increased price is 78% * 81% + 22% * 44% = 0.78 * 0.81 + 0.22 * 0.44 = 0.6306 + 0.0968 = 0.7274. The probability of reduced price is 1 - 0.7274 = 0.2726. Therefore, increased price is less likely than reduced price overall.
