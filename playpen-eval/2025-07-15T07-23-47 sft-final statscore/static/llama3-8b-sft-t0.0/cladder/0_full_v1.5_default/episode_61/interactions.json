The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the following events:\n- \\(E\\) as the event of encouragement,\n- \\(D\\) as the event of discouragement,\n- \\(B\\) as the event of brown eyes.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- \\(P(E) = 0.91\\),\n- \\(P(D \\cap B) = 0.07\\),\n- \\(P(E \\cap B) = 0.58\\).\n\nWe need to find \\(P(B|E)\\), the probability of brown eyes given encouragement.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n\\[P(B|E) = \\frac{P(E \\cap B)}{P(E)}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[P(B|E) = \\frac{0.58}{0.91}\\]\n\nCalculating the value:\n\\[P(B|E) \\approx 0.637\\]\n\nSince \\(0.637 > 0.5\\), the chance of brown eyes is larger when observing encouragement.\n\nThus, the answer is:\nYes",
