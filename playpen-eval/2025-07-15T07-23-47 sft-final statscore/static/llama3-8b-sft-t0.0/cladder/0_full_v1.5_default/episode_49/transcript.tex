	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 41%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 59%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 33%. Is cholera contraction more likely than cholera prevention overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of cholera contraction for people who like spicy food is 33%, and the probability of cholera contraction for people who do not like spicy food is 59%. Since the overall probability of liking spicy food is 41%, the weighted average of the probabilities of cholera contraction is 0.41 * 0.33 + 0.59 * 0.59 = 0.33 + 0.3481 = 0.6781. This is greater than 0.5, so cholera contraction is more likely than cholera prevention overall.
