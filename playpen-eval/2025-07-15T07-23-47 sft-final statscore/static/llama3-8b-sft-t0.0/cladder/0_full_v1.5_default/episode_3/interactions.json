The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. Method 1: We look at how manager correlates with employee case by case according to director. Method 2: We look directly at how manager correlates with employee in general. To understand how manager affects employee, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Therefore, to understand how manager affects employee, it is more correct to use Method 1, which takes into account the effect of director on employee, rather than Method 2, which does not consider the mediating role of director. This is because the effect of manager on employee is not direct but rather indirect through director, and Method 1 captures this indirect relationship more accurately.",
