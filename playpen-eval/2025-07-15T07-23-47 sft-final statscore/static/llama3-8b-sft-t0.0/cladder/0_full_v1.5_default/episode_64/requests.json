The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on rixq and xevu. Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 15%. For those who are not zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 50%. For those who are zuph and are not rixq, the probability of xevu is 32%. For those who are zuph and are rixq, the probability of xevu is 85%. The overall probability of zuph is 84%. Will rixq increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of xevu is 50% for those who are not zuph and are rixq, which is higher than the probability of 15% for those who are not zuph and are not rixq. Additionally, the probability of xevu is 85% for those who are zuph and are rixq, which is higher than the probability of 32% for those who are zuph and are not rixq. Therefore, being rixq increases the chance of xevu.<|eot_id|>",
