Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
