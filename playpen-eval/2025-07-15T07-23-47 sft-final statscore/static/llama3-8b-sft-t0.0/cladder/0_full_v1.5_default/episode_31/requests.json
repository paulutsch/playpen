The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Gene and Smoking Relationship:**\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%.\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%.\n\n2. **Pollution and Smoking Relationship:**\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%.\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%.\n\n3. **Overall Probability of High Pollution:**\n   - The overall probability of high pollution is 41%.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of gene on lung cancer through smoking:\n\n- **Nonsmoking Genes:**\n  - Without considering pollution, the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers (42%) than nonsmokers (56%) among those with nonsmoking genes.
