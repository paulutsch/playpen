The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Gene and Smoking Relationship:**\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%.\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%.\n\n2. **Pollution and Smoking Relationship:**\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%.\n   - For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%.\n   - For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%.\n\n3. **Overall Probability of High Pollution:**\n   - The overall probability of high pollution is 41%.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of gene on lung cancer through smoking:\n\n- **Nonsmoking Genes:**\n  - Without considering pollution, the probability of lung cancer is higher for smokers (42%) than nonsmokers (56%) among those with nonsmoking genes.
