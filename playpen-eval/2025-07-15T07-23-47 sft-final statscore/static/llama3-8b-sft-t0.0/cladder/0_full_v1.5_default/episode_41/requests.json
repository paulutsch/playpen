Skill has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%. The probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%. The probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%. Is the chance of black hair smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of black hair given college degree or higher is 3% / 6% = 0.5, while the probability of black hair given high school degree or lower is 25% / 75% = 1/3. Since 0.5 < 1/3, the chance of black hair is smaller when observing college degree or higher.<|eot_id|>",
