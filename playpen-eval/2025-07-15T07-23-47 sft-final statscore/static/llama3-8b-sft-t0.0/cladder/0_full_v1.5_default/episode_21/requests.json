The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. The overall probability of waking up late is 5%. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%. Is arriving to school on time more likely than arriving to school late overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall probability of arriving to school on time can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of waking up on time: 95% (since the probability of waking up late is 5%)\n- Probability of arriving to school on time when waking up on time: 52%\n- Probability of arriving to school on time when waking up late: 87%\n\nThe overall probability of arriving to school on time is:\n95% * 52% + 5% * 87% = 0.95 * 0.52 + 0.05 * 0.87 = 0.494 + 0.0435 = 0.5375\n\nSince 0.5375 is greater than 0.4625 (which is the probability of arriving to school late), arriving to school on time is more likely than arriving to school late overall.<|eot_id|>",
