The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of rixq is 40%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 9%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 22%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
