The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58%. For individuals who are not male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 59%. For individuals who are male and applicants to a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 28%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of competitive department is 29%. For individuals who are male, the probability of competitive department is 77%.

The effect of gender on admission status through department competitiveness can be determined by analyzing the given probabilities. \n\n1. **Effect of Gender on Department Competitiveness:**\n   - For individuals who are not male, the probability of being in a competitive department is 29%.\n   - For individuals who are male, the probability of being in a competitive department is 77%.\n\n2. **Effect of Department Competitiveness on Admission Status:**\n   - For individuals in a non-competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 58% (regardless of gender).\n   - For individuals in a competitive department, the probability of admission acceptance is 25% (regardless of gender).\n\n3. **Effect of Gender on Admission Status through Department Competitiveness:**\n   - **For individuals who are not male:**\n     - Probability of being in a non-competitive department: 1 - 0.29 = 0.71\n     - Probability of being in a competitive department: 0.29\n     - Probability of admission acceptance in a non-competitive department: 0.58\n     - Probability of admission acceptance in a competitive department: 0.25\n   - **For individuals who are male:**\n     - Probability of being in a non-competitive department: 1 - 0.77 = 0.23\n     - Probability of being in a competitive department: 0.77\n     - Probability of admission acceptance in a non",
