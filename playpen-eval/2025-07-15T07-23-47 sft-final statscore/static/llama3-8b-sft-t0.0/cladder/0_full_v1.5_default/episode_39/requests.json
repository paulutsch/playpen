The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of large feet for people not using tanning salon treatments is 13%, and the probability of large feet for people who went to tanning salons is 70%. Since the overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%, the overall probability of large feet is 0.1 * 0.7 + 0.9 * 0.13 = 0.07 + 0.117 = 0.187. Since 0.187 is greater than 0.5, large feet are more likely than small feet overall.<|eot_id|>",
