	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes. The probability of scurvy for patients not consuming citrus is 73%, and for patients consuming citrus, it is 54%. This indicates that eating citrus reduces the probability of scurvy. Since vitmain C is the direct effect of eating citrus and also the direct cause of scurvy, it can be inferred that eating citrus positively affects scurvy through vitmain C.
