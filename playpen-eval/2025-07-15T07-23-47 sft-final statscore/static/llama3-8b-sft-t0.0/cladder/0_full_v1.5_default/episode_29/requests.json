The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Eating citrus has a direct effect on vitmain C. Vitmain C has a direct effect on scurvy. For patients not consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 73%. For patients consuming citrus, the probability of scurvy is 54%. Does eating citrus positively affect scurvy through vitmain C?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of scurvy for patients not consuming citrus is 73%, and for patients consuming citrus, it is 54%. This indicates that eating citrus reduces the probability of scurvy. Since vitmain C is the direct effect of eating citrus and also the direct cause of scurvy, it can be inferred that eating citrus positively affects scurvy through vitmain C.<|eot_id|>",
