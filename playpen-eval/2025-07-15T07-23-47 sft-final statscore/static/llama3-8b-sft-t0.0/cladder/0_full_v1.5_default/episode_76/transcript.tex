	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on zupj and muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. The overall probability of yupt is 1%. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%. Is muvq more likely than not muvq overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 To solve this problem, we need to determine the overall probability of muvq in the hypothetical world. We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. The probability of yupt is 1%.\\ \tt 2. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%.\\ \tt 3. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of muvq. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event A can be calculated as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt \[ P(A) = P(A|B_1) \times P(B_1) + P(A|B_2) \times P(B_2) + \ldots + P(A|B_n) \times P(B_n) \]\\ \tt \\ \tt where \( P(A|B_i) \) is the probability of event A given that event \( B_i \) has occurred, and \( P(B_i) \) is the probability of event \( B_i \).\\ \tt \\ \tt In this case, we want to find the overall probability of muvq, denoted as \( P(\text{muvq}) \). We have two conditions:\\ \tt \\ \tt - If yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%, denoted as \( P(\text{muvq}|\text{yupt}) = 0.59 \).\\ \tt - If not yupt, the probability of muvq
