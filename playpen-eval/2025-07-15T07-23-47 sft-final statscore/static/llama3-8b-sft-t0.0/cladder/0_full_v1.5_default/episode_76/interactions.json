The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on zupj and muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. The overall probability of yupt is 1%. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%. Is muvq more likely than not muvq overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of yupt is 1%.\n2. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%.\n3. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%.\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of muvq. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event A can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ P(A) = P(A|B_1) \\times P(B_1) + P(A|B_2) \\times P(B_2) + \\ldots + P(A|B_n) \\times P(B_n) \\]\n\nwhere \\( P(A|B_i) \\) is the probability of event A given that event \\( B_i \\) has occurred, and \\( P(B_i) \\) is the probability of event \\( B_i \\).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the overall probability of muvq, denoted as \\( P(\\text{muvq}) \\). We have two conditions:\n\n- If yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%, denoted as \\( P(\\text{muvq}|\\text{yupt}) = 0.59 \\).\n- If not yupt, the probability of muvq",
