The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Husband has a direct effect on wife and alarm clock. Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%, and the overall probability of alarm not set by husband is 92%. The overall probability of alarm ringing is 8% * 16% + 92% * 75% = 0.128 + 0.69 = 0.818. The overall probability of alarm silent is 1 - 0.818 = 0.182.
