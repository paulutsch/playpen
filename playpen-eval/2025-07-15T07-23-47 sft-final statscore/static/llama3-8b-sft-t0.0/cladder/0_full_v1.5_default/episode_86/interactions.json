The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%. Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

The probability of jyka (P(jyka)) is 14%.\n2. The probability of not jyka and lirg (P(not jyka and lirg)) is 72%.\n3. The probability of jyka and lirg (P(jyka and lirg)) is 12%.\n\nWe need to find the probability of lirg given jyka, denoted as P(lirg|jyka).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express the probability of lirg as follows:\n\nP(lirg) = P(jyka and lirg) + P(not jyka and lirg)\n\nWe are given P(jyka and lirg) = 12% and P(not jyka and lirg) = 72%. Therefore:\n\nP(lirg) = 12% + 72% = 84%\n\nNow, we need to find P(lirg|jyka). We can use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(lirg|jyka) = P(jyka and lirg) / P(jyka)\n\nWe are given P(jyka) = 14% and P(jyka and lir",
