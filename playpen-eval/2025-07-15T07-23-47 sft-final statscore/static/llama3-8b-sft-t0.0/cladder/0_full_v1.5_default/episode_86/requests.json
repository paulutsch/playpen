Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%.

We are given the following information:\n\n1. The probability of jyka (P(jyka)) is 14%.\n2. The probability of not jyka and lirg (P(not jyka and lirg)) is 72%.\n3. The probability of jyka and lirg (P(jyka and lirg)) is 12%.\n\nWe need to find the probability of lirg given jyka, denoted as P(lirg|jyka).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express the probability of lirg as follows:\n\nP(lirg) = P(jyka and lirg) + P(not jyka and lirg)\n\nWe are given P(jyka and lirg) = 12% and P(not jyka and lirg) = 72%. Therefore:\n\nP(lirg) = 12% + 72% = 84%\n\nNow, we need to find P(lirg|jyka). We can use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(lirg|jyka) = P(jyka and lirg) / P(jyka)\n\nWe are given P(jyka) = 14% and P(jyka and lir",
