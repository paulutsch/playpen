The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of lung cancer is 0.58 for nonsmokers and 0.61 for smokers. The overall probability of smoking is 0.12. Therefore, the overall probability of lung cancer is 0.12 * 0.61 + 0.88 * 0.58 = 0.58 + 0.512 = 1.092. Since 1.092 is greater than 0.5, lung cancer is more likely than absence of lung cancer overall.<|eot_id|>",
