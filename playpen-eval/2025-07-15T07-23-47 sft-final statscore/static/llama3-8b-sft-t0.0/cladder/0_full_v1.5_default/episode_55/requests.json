We are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%.\n2. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%.\n3. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(L) \\) as the probability of waking up late,\n- \\( P(H|L) \\) as the probability of high rainfall given that Alice wakes up late,\n- \\( P(H|T) \\) as the probability of high rainfall given that Alice wakes up on time.\n\nWe are asked to determine if \\( P(H|L) < P(H|T) \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of waking up on time, which is \\( P(T) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91 \\).\n\nNext, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of high rainfall:\n\n\\[ P(H) = P(H|L) \\times P(L) + P(H|T) \\times P(T) \\]\n\nWe are given that the probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%, so \\( P(H|T) \\times P(T) = 0.53 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[ P(H|T)",
